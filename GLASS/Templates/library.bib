abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z {\~{}} 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations ({\~{}}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is {\~{}}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 - 0.026 ± 0.003 × t)log M * - (6.51 ± 0.24 - 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1$\sigma$ spread in formation times of {\~{}}1.4 Gyr.},

abstract = {We utilize the CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble) observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs). The selections are carried out in two central bands: F105W (Y105) and F125W (J125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by the presence of [O III] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79, respectively. The multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalent widths of emission lines. Thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52 candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame [O III] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. Our samples include a number of EELGs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, and the extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies. These EELGs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshift galaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxies when the S/N ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. We predict that the fraction of EELGs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannot be neglected.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of primeval large-scale structures (LSSs) including two protoclusters in a forming phase at z=5.7. We carried out extensive deep narrowband imaging in the 1 deg2 sky of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field and obtained a cosmic map of 515 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in a volume with a transverse dimension of 180 Mpc×180 Mpc and a depth of {\~{}}40 Mpc in comoving units. This cosmic map shows filamentary LSSs, including clusters and surrounding 10-40 Mpc scale voids, similar to the present-day LSSs. Our spectroscopic follow-up observations identify overdense regions in which two dense clumps of LAEs with a sphere of 1 Mpc diameter in physical units are included. These clumps show about 130 times higher star formation rate density, mainly due to a large overdensity, {\~{}}80, of LAEs. These clumps would be clusters in a formation phase involving a burst of galaxy formation.

The striking anti-correlation with the HST/WFC3 imaging suggests that the copious dust surrounding the starburst heavily obscures the rest-frame UV/optical emission. A comparison with 1.2 mm PdBI continuum data reveals no evidence for variations in the dust properties across the source within the uncertainties, consistent with extended star formation, and the peak star formation rate surface density (119{\$}\backslashpm{\$}8 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} kpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}) implies that the star formation in GN20 remains sub-Eddington on scales down to 3 kpc{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}.

abstract = {Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy evolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law in the distant Universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at z = 1.5--3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}TIR{\}}{\}}/L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}UV{\}}{\}}{\$}) and UV slope ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model, {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda,\backslashdelta{\}}=E(B-V)\backslash k{\_}\backslashlambda\backslash (\backslashlambda/\backslashlambda{\_}V){\^{}}\backslashdelta{\$} where {\$}k{\_}\backslashlambda{\$} is the dust law of Calzetti et al.

Galaxies with high color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star-formation rate, or {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}. The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a mixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher ({\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}) redshifts.},

abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies at z{\~{}}3 to establish a relationship between reddening, neutral gas covering fraction (fcov(HI)), and the escape of ionizing photons at high redshift. Our sample includes 933 galaxies at z{\~{}}3, 121 of which have very deep spectroscopic observations ({\textgreater}7 hrs) in the rest-UV (lambda=850-1300 A) with Keck/LRIS. Based on the high covering fraction of outflowing optically-thick HI indicated by the composite spectra of these galaxies, we conclude that photoelectric absorption, rather than dust attenuation, dominates the depletion of ionizing photons. By modeling the composite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum including nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by HI and reddened by a line-of-sight extinction, we derive an empirical relationship between E(B-V) and fcov(HI). Galaxies with redder UV continua have larger covering fractions of HI characterized by higher line-of-sight extinctions. Our results are consistent with the escape of Lya through gas-free lines-of-sight. Covering fractions based on low-ionization interstellar absorption lines systematically underpredict those deduced from the HI lines, suggesting that much of the outflowing gas may be metal-poor. We develop a model which connects the ionizing escape fraction with E(B-V), and which may be used to estimate the escape fraction for an ensemble of high-redshift galaxies. Alternatively, direct measurements of the escape fraction for our data allow us to constrain the intrinsic 900-to-1500 A flux density ratio to be {\textgreater}0.20, a value that favors stellar population models that include weaker stellar winds, a flatter initial mass function, and/or binary evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate how the framework discussed here may be used to assess the pathways by which ionizing radiation escapes from high-redshift galaxies. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the rest-frame B-band COMBO-17 and DEEP2 luminosity functions (LFs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) as a function of luminosity and mass. Our aim is to place new stringent constraints on the evolution of ETGs since z{\~{}}1. We correct the LF({\$}z{\$}) data for the luminosity dimming assuming pure luminosity evolution. However, instead of relying on stellar population synthesis model--dependent assumptions, we adopt the empirical luminosity dimming rate derived from the evolution of the Fundamental Plane of field and cluster massive ETGs.Our results show that the amount of evolution for the ETG population depends critically on the range of luminosity and masses considered. While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with M{\_}B(z=0){\textless} -20.5 (Mass {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun) is nearly constant since z{\~{}}0.8, less luminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be explained with a gradual population of the ETG "red sequence" by the progressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than {\~{}}10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs appear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular "downsizing" scenario. However, ``downsizing'' does not appear to be limited to star formation, but the concept may have to be extended to the mass assembly itself as the build-up of the most massive galaxies preceeds that of the less massive ones. This evolutionary trend is not reproduced by the most recent theoretical simulations even when they successfully reproduce "downsizing" in star formation.},

abstract = {The unidentified infrared emission features (UIR bands) are attributed to a collection of partially hydrogenated, positively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This assignment is based on a spectroscopic analysis of the UIR bands. Comparison of the observed interstellar 6.2 and 7.7-micron bands with the laboratory measured Raman spectrum of a collection of carbon-based particulates (auto exhaust) shows a very good agreement, supporting this identification. The infrared emission is due to relaxation from highly vibrationally and electronically excited states. The excitation is probably caused by UV photon absorption. The infrared fluorescence of one particular, highly vibrationally excited PAH (chrysene) is modeled. In this analysis the species is treated as a molecule rather than bulk material and the non-thermodynamic equilibrium nature of the emission is fully taken into account. From a comparison of the observed ratio of the 3.3 to 11.3-micron UIR bands with the model calculations, the average number of carbon atoms per molecule is estimated to be about 20. The abundance of interstellar PAHs is calculated to be about 2 x 10 to the -7th with respect to hydrogen.},

abstract = {To understand how best to use observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to obtain precise and accurate distances, we investigate the relations between spectra of SNe Ia and their intrinsic colors. Using a sample of 1630 optical spectra of 255 SNe, based primarily on data from the CfA Supernova Program, we examine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of Si II 6355 and Ca II H{\&}K are related to the B-V color at peak brightness. We find that the maximum-light velocity of Si II 6355 and Ca II H{\&}K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si II 6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si II 6355 measurements. Ca II H{\&}K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia --- even after removing a linear trend with velocity --- indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more "standard crayons." Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

abstract = {Supernovae are essential to understanding the chemical evolution of the Universe. Type Ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational tool currently available for studying the expansion history of the Universe and the nature of dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study of their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently available data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae are rather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are poorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose spectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with precise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing photometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on telescope/filter/detector systems that are well understood and well characterized. During a five-year program which began in September 2004, we expect to obtain high-precision u'g'r'i'BVYJHKs light curves and optical spectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the CSP survey observing and data reduction methodology. In addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectra obtained for a few representative supernovae during the first observing campaign.},

By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 2{\$}, instead of the {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 4{\$} one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

Its light curves are similar to the prototypical SN2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a later rise to maximum in g. SN2009ku is brighter ({\~{}}0.6 mag) than other SN2002cx-like objects, peaking at M{\_}V = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter than typical SNeIa. SN2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of {\~{}}2000 kms{\^{}}-1 at 18 days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to SN2008ha, which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. However, SN2008ha had an exceedingly low luminosity, peaking at M{\_}V = -14.2 mag, {\~{}}4 mag fainter than SN2009ku. The contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for SN2009ku is contrary to an emerging trend seen for the SN2002cx class. SN2009ku is a counter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneous than typical SNeIa, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitor population and/or complicated explosion physics. As the first example of a member of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys, SN2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare and interesting objects.},

abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of the LCDM cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z{\~{}}0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the "concordance" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z{\textgreater}2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z{\~{}}3-4).},

Using these expressions we have derived heavy element abundances in the {\~{}}310 emission-line galaxies from the Data Release 3 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with an observed H$\beta$ flux F(H$\beta$) {\textgreater} 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 and for which the [O iii] $\lambda$4363 emission line was detected at least at a 2$\sigma$ level, allowing abundance determination by direct methods. The oxygen abundance 12 + log O/H of the SDSS galaxies lies in the range from {\~{}}7.1 (Zȯ/30) to {\~{}}8.5 (0.7 Zȯ). The SDSS sample is merged with a sample of 109 blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies with high quality spectra, which contains extremely low-metallicity objects. We use the merged sample to study the abundance patterns of low-metallicity emission-line galaxies. We find that extremely metal-poor galaxies (12 + log O/H {\textless} 7.6, i.e. Z {\textless} Zȯ/12) are rare in the SDSS sample. The $\alpha$ element-to-oxygen abundance ratios do not show any significant trends with oxygen abundance, in agreement with previous studies, except for a slight increase of Ne/O with increasing metallicity, which we interpret as due to a moderate depletion of O onto grains in the most metal-rich galaxies. The Fe/O abundance ratio is smaller than the solar value, by up to 1 dex at the high metallicity end. We also find that Fe/O increases with decreasing H$\beta$ equivalent width EW(H$\beta$). We interpret this as a sign of strong depletion onto dust grains, and gradual destruction of those grains on a time scale of a few Myr. All the galaxies are found to have log N/O {\textgreater} -1.6, implying that they have a different nature than the subsample of high-redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ systems with log N/O of {\~{}}-2.3 and that their ages are larger than 100-300 Myr. We confirm the apparent increase in N/O with decreasing EW(H$\beta$), already shown in previous studies, and explain it as the signature of gradual nitrogen ejection by massive stars from the most recent starburst.},

One group ("Normal") consists of normal SNe Ia populating a narrow strip in the Si II velocity distribution, with an average expansion velocity v=10,600+/-400 km/s near B maximum; the other group ("HV") consists of objects with higher velocities, v {\textgreater} 11,800 km/s. Compared with the Normal group, the HV one shows a narrower distribution in both the peak luminosity and the luminosity decline rate dm{\_}{\{}15{\}}. In particular, their B-V colors at maximum brightness are found to be on average redder by {\~{}}0.1, suggesting that they either are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red B-V colors.

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

abstract = {Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes [taken here as the flux within 2RP, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/$\eta$(RP)=0.2] can represent most of an object's$\backslash$nflux, they do of course miss the light outside the Petrosian aperture (2RP). The size of this flux deficit varies monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light profile, i.e., its concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R1/4 profile, the deficit is 0.20 mag; for an R1/8 profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide a simple method for recovering total (S{\'{e}}rsic)$\backslash$nmagnitudes from Petrosian magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R90/R50 or R80/R20) within the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that$\backslash$nS{\'{e}}rsic's model provides a good description of a galaxy's$\backslash$nluminosity profile. We show how the concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface brightness. Our technique is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) Petrosian parameters, yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean effective surface brightnesses obtained from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog S{\'{e}}rsic$\backslash$nR1/n fits by Blanton and coworkers. Although the corrective procedure described here is specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be constructed.},

abstract = {The properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derived from fitting far-IR SEDs ({\textgreater}100 micron). Only with SPIRE on Herschel has it been possible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond the peak ({\~{}}160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. We investigate the differences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only {\textless}200 micron data and then also including {\textgreater}200 micron data (new SPIRE observations) to determine how important having {\textgreater}200 micron data is for deriving these dust properties. We fit the 100 to 350 micron observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) point-by-point with a model that consists of a single temperature and fixed emissivity law. The data used are existing observations at 100 and 160 micron (from IRAS and Spitzer) and new SPIRE observations of 1/4 of the LMC observed for the HERITAGE Key Project as part of the Herschel Science Demonstration phase. The dust temperatures and masses computed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, from those that also include the SPIRE 250 {\&} 350 micron data. We find that an emissivity law proportional to lambda{\^{}}-1.5 minimizes the 100-350 micron fractional residuals. We find that the emission at 500 micron is {\~{}}10{\%} higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths. We find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with MIPS 24 micron flux and the total gas surface density. This argues against a flux calibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelength dependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable at lambda {\textgreater} 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.},

abstract = {We utilize for the first time Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging to examine the structural properties of galaxies in the rest-frame U - V versus V - J diagram (i.e., the UVJ diagram) using a sample at 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (log M/M ⊙ {\textgreater}10.25). The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most of them to have concentrated profiles with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices (n {\textgreater} 2.5) and smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix of S{\'{e}}rsic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ-selected SFGs with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the n {\textless} 2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of an SFG on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally display redder colors and lower [O II]$\lambda$3727 luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early- and late-type galaxies.

abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q{\_}z, that provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

abstract = {We study integrated characteristics of {\~{}}14000 low-redshift (0{\textless}z{\textless}1) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) selected from the Data Release 12 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It is found that emission of these galaxies is dominated by strong young bursts of star formation, implying that their luminosities experience rapid variations on a time scale of a few Myr. Reducing integrated characteristics of these galaxies to zero burst age would result in a considerably tighter and almost linear relation between stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). The same correction implies that the specific star formation rate (the ratio of SFR and stellar mass) is not dependent on the galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that the correction for rapid luminosity evolution must be taken into account in a similar way when comparing different samples of low- and high-redshift SFGs. If the bursting nature of star formation and young burst ages are characteristics of the galaxies selected at high redshifts, the age correction of observed SFRs derived from the Hbeta emission line or UV continua would modify the derived SFR densities in the early universe.},

abstract = {We develop a method for interpreting faint galaxy data which focuses on the integrated light radiated from the galaxy population as a whole. The emission history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths is modeled from the present epoch to z{\~{}}4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. The global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fit by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal IMF extending from 0.1 to 125 M{\_}sun. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z{\~{}}1.5, to fall again at higher redshifts. The models are able to account for the entire background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels probed by the HDF. Since only 20{\%} of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z{\textgreater}2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyman-$\backslash$alpha systems. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the present-day stars formed at z{\textgreater}2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high redshifts as sampled by QSO absorbers.},

Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced nearby SN Ia (z {\textless} 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.},

abstract = {We present UBVRIz lightcurves of the Type Ia SN 1999ee and the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex, both located in the galaxy IC 5179. SN 1999ee has an extremely well sampled lightcurve spanning from 10 days before Bmax through 53 days after peak. Near maximum we find systematic differences {\~{}}0.05 mag in photometry measured with two different telescopes, even though the photometry is reduced to the same local standards around the supernova using the specific color terms for each instrumental system. We use models for our bandpasses and spectrophotometry of SN 1999ee to derive magnitude corrections (S-corrections) and remedy this problem. This exercise demonstrates the need of accurately characterizing the instrumental system before great photometric accuracies of Type Ia supernovae can be claimed. It also shows that this effect can have important astrophysical consequences since a small systematic shift of 0.02 mag in the B-V color can introduce a 0.08 mag error in the extinction corrected peak B magnitudes of a supernova and thus lead to biased cosmological parameters. The data for the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex present us with the first ever observed shock breakout of a supernova of this class. These observations show that shock breakout occurred 18 days before Bmax and support the idea that Type Ib/c supernovae are due to core collapse of massive stars rather than thermonuclear disruption of white dwarfs.},

The method is based on nth root and nth power equalization approach but with optimization of the mean of the image in different colour channels such as RGB and HSI. The performance of the proposed method has been measured by the means of peak signal to noise ratio. The proposed algorithm has been compared with conventional histogram equalization and the visual and quantitative experimental results are showing that the proposed method over perform the histogram equalization.},

abstract = {The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have obtained WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and imaging over five fields, comprising a total area of {\~{}}900 sq. arcmin: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the HST data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3um -8um. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point spread function into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. In a companion paper (I. Momcheva et al., in preparation) we present line diagnostics and improved redshifts from an analysis of the combination of the photometry with the grism spectra. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST website.},

abstract = {Since low-mass stars have low luminosities, orbits at which liquid water can exist on Earth-sized planets are relatively close-in, which produces Doppler signals that are detectable using state-of-the-art Doppler spectroscopy. GJ 667C is already known to be orbited by two super-Earth candidates. We investigate whether the data supports the presence of additional companions. We obtain new Doppler measurements from HARPS extracted spectra and combined them with those obtained from the PFS and HIRES spectrographs. We used Bayesian and periodogram-based methods to re-assess the number of candidates and evaluated the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler signal activity indices and investigate quasi-periodicity. Doppler measurements of GJ 667C are described better by six Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates (b and c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62 and 39 days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day orbit (g) and tantalizing evidence of a {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1 M{\$}{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We explore whether long-term stable orbits are compatible with the data by integrating 8{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}4{\$} solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. The system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable configurations. As for the solar system, the most stable solutions do not contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic Laplace-Lagrange solutions. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of stability left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects, indicate that three (maybe four) planets are potentially habitable...},

abstract = {In this paper, instead of invoking Dark Energy, we try and fit various cosmological observations with a large Gpc scale under-dense region (Void) which is modeled by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that at large distances becomes a homogeneous FLRW metric. We improve on previous analyses by allowing for nonzero overall curvature, accurately computing the distance to the last-scattering surface and the observed scale of the Baryon Acoustic peaks, and investigating important effects that could arise from having nontrivial Void density profiles. We mainly focus on the WMAP 7-yr data (TT and TE), Supernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data (SDSS and LRG). We find that the inclusion of a nonzero overall curvature drastically improves the goodness of fit of the Void model, bringing it very close to that of a homogeneous universe containing Dark Energy, while by varying the profile one can increase the value of the local Hubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models. We also try to gauge how well our model can fit the large-scale-structure data, but a comprehensive analysis will require the knowledge of perturbations on LTB metrics. The model is consistent with the CMB dipole if the observer is about 15 Mpc off the centre of the Void. Remarkably, such an off-center position may be able to account for the recent anomalous measurements of a large bulk flow from kSZ data. Finally we provide several analytical approximations in different regimes for the LTB metric, and a numerical module for CosmoMC, thus allowing for a MCMC exploration of the full parameter space.},

abstract = {We explore the relationship between gas, dust and star formation in a sample of 12 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at high redshift compared to a similar sample of local galaxies. We present new CO observations and/or Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy for 6 70 micron selected galaxies at z{\~{}}1 in order to quantify the properties of the molecular gas reservoir, the contribution of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the mid-IR luminosity and the star formation efficiency (SFE=LIR/L'CO). The mid-IR spectra show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the AGN makes a minimal contribution ({\textless}25{\%}) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron selected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to have high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter galaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major merger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs, we further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio LPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high redshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher IR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is {\~{}}3 times higher at high redshift. When we normalize by the molecular gas, we find this trend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas is correlated with the PAH dust emission.The similar trends seen in the [CII] to molecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that PAH emission, like [CII], continues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at high redshift. Together the CO, PAH and far-IR fine structure lines should be useful for constraining the interstellar medium conditions in high redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {Chemical tagging promises to use detailed abundance measurements to identify spatially separated stars that were in fact born together (in the same molecular cloud), long ago. This idea has not previously yielded scientific successes, probably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance measurements. However, we have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has delivered 15 individual abundances for 100,000 stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space. We recover some known phase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This confirms the chemical-tagging hypothesis and verifies the precision of the abundance measurements delivered by The Cannon. This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures by blind search purely in abundance space; the prospects for future data sets are very good.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions mark the end of the tumultuous life of massive stars. Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step towards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has been directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from massive stars that lose their Hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from binary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the primary. Here we analyze recently-reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which could possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on pre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models of single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor candidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming the scenario from Cao et al 2013. We find that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the observed photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a luminosity of log (L/Lsun){\~{}}5.55, surface temperature {\~{}}45000 K, and mass of {\~{}}10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model overestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could be likely reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50 Msun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. If the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest that stars with relatively high initial masses ({\textgreater}30 Msun) can produce visible SN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole.},

Furthermore, we stack galaxy images to measure average radial color profiles as a function of mass. Negative color gradients are only present for massive star-forming field and cluster galaxies with log(M){\textgreater}10.4, the remaining galaxy masses and types have flat profiles. Our results suggest given the observed differences in size and color of star-forming field and cluster galaxies, that the environment has begun to influence/accelerate their evolution.

abstract = {We present a combined analysis of rest-frame far-UV (1000-2000 A) and rest-frame optical (3600-7000 A) composite spectra formed from very deep observations of a sample of 30 star-forming galaxies with z=2.4+/-0.1, selected to be representative of the full KBSS-MOSFIRE spectroscopic survey. Since the same massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and the excitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar population synthesis model must simultaneously match the details of the far-UV stellar+nebular continuum and-- when inserted as the excitation source in photoionization models-- account for all observed nebular emission line ratios. We find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar metallicity (Z{\_}*/Z{\_}{\{}sun{\}} {\~{}} 0.1) but relatively high ionized gas-phase oxygen abundances (Z{\_}{\{}neb{\}}/Z{\_}{\{}sun{\}} {\~{}} 0.5), can successfully match all of the observational constraints. We argue that this apparent discrepancy is naturally explained by highly super-solar O/Fe [4-5 times (O/Fe){\_}{\{}sun{\}}], expected for gas whose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. Once the correct ionizing spectrum is identified, photoionization models reproduce all of the observed strong emission line ratios, the direct T{\_}e measurement of O/H, and allow accurate measurement of the gas-phase abundance ratios of N/O and C/O -- both of which are significantly sub-solar but, as for O/Fe, are in remarkable agreement with abundance patterns observed in Galactic thick disk, bulge, and halo stars with similar O/H. High nebular excitation is the rule at high-z (and rare at low-z) because of systematically shorter enrichment timescales ({\textless}{\textless}1 Gyr): low Fe/O environments produce harder (and longer-lived) stellar EUV spectra at a given O/H, enhanced by dramatic effects on the evolution of massive star binaries.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the COSMOS survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after removing AGN contaminants from the sample. Dust unbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: i) specific star formation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects; iii) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to grossly underestimate the SFR in massive galaxies; iv) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the mean specific star formation rate of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of {\~{}}4 with decreasing redshift from z=2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of {\~{}}40 down the local Universe.   These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.},

A simultaneous {\$}\backslashchi {\^{}}2{\$} minimization yields a standardized absolute luminosity of the Cepheid-calibrated supernovae as well as the Hubble constant obtained from the more distant sample.

The sensitivity of {\$}H{\_}0{\$} to a metallicity dependence of the Cepheid-determined distances is investigated.

abstract = {We present results on the variation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 micron in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z{\~{}}2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37{\$}\backslashleq z\backslashleq{\$}2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and far-IR data from Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron to measure total IR luminosities (L(IR)). We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$}) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH molecules in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile in our sample (ages of {\~{}} 400 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of {\~{}}2 for galaxies with masses M{\$}{\_}*{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, compared to the more massive ones.

Consequently, the SFR-M{\$}{\_}*{\$} relation has a shallower slope than previously derived from studies that neglected the metallicity dependence of the 24 micron-to-IR conversion factor.

abstract = {We present multi-band optical photometry of 94 spectroscopically-confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the redshift range 0.0055 to 0.073, obtained between 2006 and 2011. There are a total of 5522 light curve points. We show that our natural system SN photometry has a precision of roughly 0.03 mag or better in BVr'i', 0.06 mag in u', and 0.07 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag and estimate that it has a systematic uncertainty of 0.014, 0.010, 0.012, 0.014, 0.046, and 0.073 mag in BVr'i'u'U, respectively. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars reveal mean agreement across samples in the range of {\~{}}0.00-0.03 mag. We discuss the recent measurements of our telescope-plus-detector throughput by direct monochromatic illumination by Cramer et al (in prep.). This technique measures the whole optical path through the telescope, auxiliary optics, filters, and detector under the same conditions used to make SN measurements. Extremely well-characterized natural-system passbands (both in wavelength and over time) are crucial for the next generation of SN Ia photometry to reach the 0.01 mag accuracy level. The current sample of low-z SN Ia is now sufficiently large to remove most of the statistical sampling error from the dark energy error budget. But pursuing the dark-energy systematic errors by determining highly-accurate detector passbands, combining optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectra, using the nearby sample to illuminate the population properties of SN Ia, and measuring the local departures from the Hubble flow will benefit from larger, carefully measured nearby samples.},

Our main scientific interests in CARS are optical searches for galaxy clusters from low to high redshift and their subsequent study with photometric and weak-gravitational lensing techniques. As a first step of the project we present multi-colour catalogues from 37 sq. degrees of the CFHTLS-Wide component. Our aims are to create astrometrically and photometrically well calibrated co-added images. Second goal are five-band (u*, g', r', i', z') multi-band catalogues with an emphasis on reliable estimates for object colours. These are subsequently used for photometric redshift estimates. The article explains in detail data processing, multi-colour catalogue creation and photometric redshift estimation. Furthermore we apply a novel technique, based on studies of the angular galaxy cross-correlation function, to quantify the reliability of photo-z's. The accuracy of our high-confidence photo-z sample (10-15 galaxies per sq. arcmin) is estimated to {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashDelta{\_}z/(1+z){\}}\backslashapprox 0.04-0.05{\$} up to i'{\textless}24 with typically only 1-3{\%} outliers.

abstract = {We study dust attenuation at UV wavelengths at high redshift, where the UV is redshifted to the observed visible. In particular, we search for a UV bump and related implications for dust attenuation determinations. We use data in the CDFS, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project, to sample the UV rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0.95{\textless}z{\textless}2.2. When available, Herschel/PACS data (GOODS-Herschel project), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements, are used to estimate the dust emission. The SED of each source is fit using the CIGALE code. The amount of dust attenuation and the dust attenuation curve are obtained as outputs of the SED fitting process, together with other parameters linked to the SFH. The global amount of dust attenuation at UV wavelengths is found to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as UV luminosity increases. A UV bump at 2175A is securely detected in 20{\%} of the galaxies, and the mean amplitude of the bump for the sample is similar to that observed in the LMC supershell region. This amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with very high SSFRs, and 90{\%} of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z{\textless}1.5. The attenuation curve is confirmed to be steeper than that of local starburst galaxies for 20{\$}{\%} of the galaxies. The large dispersion found for these two parameters describing the attenuation law is likely to reflect a wide diversity of attenuation laws among galaxies. The relations between dust attenuation, IR-to-UV flux ratio, and the slope of the UV continuum are derived for the mean attenuation curve found for our sample. Deviations from the average trends are found to correlate with the age of the young stellar population and the shape of the attenuation curve.(abriged)},

abstract = {We present two-dimensional spectroscopy of the extremely metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy SBS 0335-052E aiming to studyphysical conditions, element abundances and kinematical properties of the ionised gas in this galaxy. Observations were obtained in the spectral range 3620-9400A with the imaging spectrograph GIRAFFE installed on the UT2 of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). These observations are the first ones carried out so far with GIRAFFE in the ARGUS mode which allows to obtain simultaneously 308 spectra covering a 11.4"x7.3" region. We produced images of SBS 0335-052E in the continuum and in emission lines of different stages of excitation. We find that while the maximum of emission in the majority of lines, including the strong lines Hbeta 4861A, Halpha 6563A, [OIII] 4363,5007A, [OII] 3726,3729A, coincides with the youngest south-eastern star clusters 1 and 2, the emission of HeII 4686A line is offset to the more evolved north-west clusters 4,5. This suggests that hard ionising radiation responsible for the HeII 4686A emission is not related to the most massive youngest stars, but rather is connected with fast radiative shocks. This conclusion is supported by the kinematical properties of the ionised gas from the different emission lines as the velocity dispersion in the HeII 4686A line is systematically higher, by {\~{}}50{\%}-100{\%}, than that in other lines. The variations of the emission line profiles suggest the presence of an ionised gas outflow in the direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk. (abridged)},

Good progress has been made in charting the end of reionization through spectroscopic studies of z{\~{}}6-8 QSOs, gamma-ray bursts and galaxies expected to host Lyman-alpha emission. However, the most stringent constraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, tau, of Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background. Using the latest data on the abundance and luminosity distribution of distant galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we simultaneously match the reduced value tau=0.066 +/- 0.012 recently reported by the Planck collaboration and the evolving neutrality of the intergalactic medium with a reionization history within 6 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 10, thereby reducing the requirement for a significant population of very high redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textgreater}10) galaxies.

abstract = {Despite decades of study, we still do not fully understand why some massive galaxies abruptly switch off their star formation in the early Universe, and what causes their rapid transition to the red sequence. Post-starburst galaxies provide a rare opportunity to study this transition phase, but few have currently been spectroscopically identified at high redshift ({\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}). In this paper we present the spectroscopic verification of a new photometric technique to identify post-starbursts in high-redshift surveys. The method classifies the broad-band optical-near--infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies using three spectral shape parameters (super-colours), derived from a principal component analysis of model SEDs. When applied to the multiwavelength photometric data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), this technique identified over 900 candidate post-starbursts at redshifts {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0{\$}. In this study we present deep optical spectroscopy for a subset of these galaxies, in order to confirm their post-starburst nature. Where a spectroscopic assessment was possible, we find the majority (19/24 galaxies; {\~{}}80 per cent) exhibit the strong Balmer absorption (H {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} equivalent width {\$}W{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda{\}}{\$} {\textgreater}5 Ang.) and Balmer break, characteristic of post-starburst galaxies. We conclude that photometric methods can be used to select large samples of recently-quenched galaxies in the distant Universe.},

abstract = {We study the rest-frame ultra-violet sizes of massive ({\~{}}0.8 x 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun) galaxies at 3.4{\textless}z{\textless}4.2, selected from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), by fitting single Sersic profiles to HST/WFC3/F160W images from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). Massive quiescent galaxies are very compact, with a median circularized half-light radius r{\_}e = 0.63 +/- 0.18 kpc. Removing 5/16 (31{\%}) sources with signs of AGN activity does not change the result. Star-forming galaxies have r{\_}e = 2.0 +/- 0.60 kpc, 3.2 +/- 1.3 x larger than quiescent galaxies. Quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}4 are on average 6.0 +$\backslash$- 0.17 x smaller than at z{\~{}}0 and 1.9 +/- 0.7 x smaller than at z{\~{}}2. Star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass are 2.4 +/- 0.7 x smaller than at z{\~{}}0. Overall, the size evolution at 0{\textless}z{\textless}4 is well described by a powerlaw, with r{\_}e = 5.08 +/- 0.28 (1+z){\^{}}(-1.44+/-0.08) kpc for quiescent and r{\_}e = 6.02 +/- 0.28 (1+z){\^{}}(-0.72+/-0.05) kpc for star-forming galaxies. Compact star-forming galaxies are rare in our sample: we find only 1/14 (7{\%}) with r{\_}e / (M / 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun){\^{}}0.75 {\textless} 1.5, whereas 13/16 (81{\%}) of the quiescent galaxies is compact. The number density of compact quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}4 is 1.8 +/- 0.8 x 10{\^{}}-5 Mpc{\^{}}-3 and increases rapidly, by {\textgreater}5 x, between 2{\textless}z{\textless}4. The paucity of compact star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}4 and their large rest-frame ultra-violet median sizes suggest that the formation phase of compact cores is very short and/or highly dust obscured.},

abstract = {The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) carried out high-cadence time-series observations of 27 square degrees centered on the South Celestial Pole during the Antarctic winter seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Aperture photometry of the 2008 and 2010 i-band images resulted in the discovery of over 200 variable stars. Yearly servicing left the array defocused for the 2009 winter season, during which the system also suffered from intermittent frosting and power failures. Despite these technical issues, nearly 800,000 useful images were obtained using g, r {\&} clear filters. We developed a combination of difference imaging and aperture photometry to compensate for the highly crowded, blended and defocused frames. We present details of this approach, which may be useful for the analysis of time-series data from other small-aperture telescopes regardless of their image quality. Using this approach, we were able to recover 68 previously-known variables and detected variability in 37 additional objects. We also have determined the observing statistics for Dome A during the 2009 winter season; we find the extinction due to clouds to be less than 0.1 and 0.4 mag for 40{\%} and 63{\%} of the dark time, respectively.},

abstract = {In this study we present the exploration of ∼ 500 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in and around two large scale structures at z ∼ 1 drawn from the ORELSE sur-vey. A sub-sample of these galaxies (∼ 150) were targeted for the initial phases of a near-infrared MOSFIRE spectroscopic campaign investigating the differences in selec-tions of galaxies which had recently ended a burst of star formation or had rapidly quenched (i.e., post-starburst or K+A galaxies). Selection with MOSFIRE resulted in a post-starburst sample more than double that selected by traditional z ∼ 1 (observed-frame optical) methods even after the removal of the relatively large fraction of dusty starburst galaxies selected through traditional methods. While the traditional post-starburst fraction increased with increased global density, the MOSFIRE-selected post-starburst fraction was found to be constant in field, group, and cluster environments. However, this fraction relative to the number of galaxies with ongoing star forma-tion was observed to elevate in the cluster environment. Post-starbursts selected with MOSFIRE were predominantly found to exhibit moderately strong [OII] emission originating from activity other than star formation. Such galaxies, termed K+A with ImposteR [OII]-derived Star formation (KAIROS) galaxies, were found to be consid-erably younger than traditionally-selected post-starbursts and likely undergoing some form of feedback absent or diminished in traditional post-starbursts. A comparison between the environments of the two types of post-starbursts suggests a picture in which the evolution of a post-starburst galaxy is considerably different in cluster en-vironments than in the more rarefied environments of a group or the field.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare to those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early-types. The hosts of high- luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high- luminosity AGN have strong H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and QSOs with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

abstract = {Aims. It is still not understood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the ultraviolet colour-attenuation relation of starburst galaxies. Previous work and models hint that the role of the shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations play an important role. In this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasons for this deviation. Methods. We have used the CIGALE spectral energy distribution fitting code to model the far ultraviolet to the far infrared emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiral galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We explored the influence of a wide range of physical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on any accurate determination of the attenuation from the ultraviolet colour and to discover why normal galaxies do not follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. Results. We have found that the deviation from the starburst relation can be explained best by intrinsic ultraviolet colour differences between different regions in galaxies. Variations in the shape of the attenuation curve can also play a secondary role. Standard age estimators of the stellar populations, such as the D4000 index or the birthrate parameter, prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic ultraviolet colour. These results are also retrieved on a sample of 58 spiral galaxies drawn from the Herschel Reference Survey sample when considering their integrated fluxes. Conclusions. When correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxies for the attenuation, it is crucial to consider possible variations in both the intrinsic ultraviolet colour of the stellar populations and the shape of the attenuation curve.},

abstract = {We use a sample of 90 spectroscopically-confirmed Lyman Break Galaxies with H-alpha and 24 micron observations to constrain the relationship between rest-frame 8 micron luminosity, L(8), and star formation rate (SFR) for L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2. We find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between L8 and L(Ha)/SFR for z{\~{}}2 galaxies with L(IR){\~{}}10{\^{}}10 - 10{\^{}}12 Lsun. Employing this relationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the UV slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of the vast majority of L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the local correlation. Separately, young galaxies with ages {\textless}100 Myr appear to follow an extinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburst galaxies. Therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty than inferred previously. Our results provide the first direct evidence, independent of the UV slope, for a correlation between UV and bolometric luminosity at high redshift, in the sense that UV-faint galaxies are also on average less infrared and less bolometrically-luminous than their UV-bright counterparts. Further, as the SFR increases, the UV luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding to L* at z{\~{}}2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible for modulating the bright-end of the UV luminosity function. L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2, while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibit ratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. This result is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a less metal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thus naturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicity and luminosity-obscuration relations.

abstract = {We take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of Herschel at 100 and 160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate the infrared luminosities, L(IR), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (L*) galaxies at high redshift. Our sample consists of 146 UV-selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.6 in the GOODS-North field. Supplemented with deep Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks at the positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 GHz. The comparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and calibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with UV luminosities L(UV){\textgreater}1e10 Lsun at z{\~{}}2 are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with a median L(IR)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 Lsun. Typical galaxies at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.6 have a median dust obscuration L(IR)/L(UV) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correction factor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (SFR) from the unobscured UV SFR, of 5.2+/-0.6. This result is similar to that inferred from previous investigations of the UV, H-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and X-ray properties of the same galaxies studied here. Stacking in bins of UV slope implies that L* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and that the correlation between UV slope and dustiness is similar to that found for local starburst galaxies. Hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxes validate on average the use of the local UV attenuation curve to recover the dust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In the simplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift UV attenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar and dust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.},

abstract = {We report on an accounting of the star-formation- and accretion-driven energetics of 24 $\mu$m-detected sources in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field. For sources having infrared (IR; 8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities gsim3 × 1012 L sun when derived by fitting local spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to 24 $\mu$m photometry alone, we find these IR luminosity estimates to be a factor of {\~{}}4 times larger than those estimated when the SED fitting includes additional 16 and 70 $\mu$m data (and in some cases mid-IR spectroscopy and 850 $\mu$m data). This discrepancy arises from the fact that high-luminosity sources at z Gt 0 appear to have far- to mid-IR ratios, as well as aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies in the local universe. Using our improved estimates for IR luminosity and active galactic nucleus (AGN) contributions, we investigate the evolution of the IR luminosity density versus redshift arising from star formation and AGN processes alone. We find that, within the uncertainties, the total star-formation-driven IR luminosity density is constant between 1.15 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 2.35, although our results suggest a slightly larger value at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2. AGNs appear to account for lsim18{\%} of the total IR luminosity density integrated between 0 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 2.35, contributing lsim25{\%} at each epoch. Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 1011 L sun {\textless}= L IR {\textless} 1012 L sun) appear to dominate the star formation rate density along with normal star-forming galaxies (L IR {\textless} 1011 L sun) between 0.6 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 1.15. Once beyond z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L IR {\textgreater}= 1012 L sun) becomes comparable with that of LIRGs. Using our improved IR luminosity estimates, we find existing calibrations for UV extinction corrections based on measurements of the UV spectral slope typically overcorrect UV luminosities by a factor of {\~{}}2, on average, for our sample of 24 $\mu$m-selected sources; accordingly we have derived a new UV extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.},

We find an average scatter of {\$}0.0197\backslashpm0.0003(1+z){\$} in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric redshifts. Photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitude and redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass. The 1-{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} scatter lies between {\$}0.01-0.03{\$}(1+z) for galaxies of all masses and colors below {\$}z{\textless}2.5{\$} (for {\$}H{\_}{\{}F140W{\}}{\{}{\textless}{\}}24{\$}), with the exception of a population of very red ({\$}U-V {\textgreater} 2{\$}), dusty star-forming galaxies for which the scatter increases to {\$}\backslashsim0.1(1+z){\$}. Although the overall photometric redshift accuracy for quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatter depends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type. We verify these trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend the analysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increase to {\$}\backslashsim0.046(1+z){\$} at {\$}H{\_}{\{}F160W{\}}=26{\$}. We demonstrate that photometric redshift accuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiple filter combinations. We evaluate the widths of redshift probability distribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim1.1-1.6{\$}, but that uniformly broadening the distribution does not adequately account for fitting outliers. Finally, we suggest possible applications of these data in planning for current and future surveys and simulate photometric redshift performance in the LSST, DES, and combined DES and VHS surveys.},

These measurements imply that the total dynamical masses of these systems are low (lsim 3 × 109 M ⊙). Their large [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (500-1100 {\AA}) and faint blue continuum emission imply young ages of 10-100 Myr and stellar masses of 108-109 M ⊙, confirming the presence of a violent starburst. The dynamical masses represent the first such determinations for low-mass galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1. The stellar mass formed in this vigorous starburst phase represents a large fraction of the total (dynamical) mass, without a significantly massive underlying population of older stars. The occurrence of such intense events in shallow potentials strongly suggests that supernova-driven winds must be of critical importance in the subsequent evolution of these systems.},

@article{Chilingarian2010,
abstract = {To compare photometric properties of galaxies at different redshifts, the fluxes need to be corrected for the changes of effective rest-frame wavelengths of filter bandpasses, called K-corrections. Usual approaches to compute them are based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions (SED) and, thus, require multi-colour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in cases of widely used optical and near-infrared filters, K-corrections can be precisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two parameters: redshift and one observed colour. With this minimalist approach, we present the polynomial fitting functions for K-corrections in SDSS ugriz, UKIRT WFCAM YJHK, Johnson-Cousins UBVR{\_}cI{\_}c, and 2MASS JHK{\_}s bands for galaxies at redshifts Z{\textless}0.5 based on empirically-computed values obtained by fitting combined optical-NIR SEDs of a set of 10{\^{}}5 galaxies constructed from SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS DR5 photometry using the Virtual Observatory. For luminous red galaxies we provide K-corrections as functions of their redshifts only. In two filters, g and r, we validate our solutions by computing K-corrections directly from SDSS DR7 spectra. We also present a K-corrections calculator, a web-based service for computing K-corrections on-line.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the auto- and cross-frequency power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at 250, 350, and 500um (1200, 860, and 600 GHz) from observations totaling {\~{}} 70 deg{\^{}}2 made with the SPIRE instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. We measure a fractional anisotropy dI / I = 14 +- 4{\%}, detecting signatures arising from the clustering of dusty star-forming galaxies in both the linear (2-halo) and non-linear (1-halo) regimes; and that the transition from the 2- to 1-halo terms, below which power originates predominantly from multiple galaxies within dark matter halos, occurs at k{\_}theta {\~{}} 0.1 - 0.12 arcmin{\^{}}-1 (l {\~{}} 2160 - 2380), from 250 to 500um. New to this paper is clear evidence of a dependence of the Poisson and 1-halo power on the flux-cut level of masked sources --- suggesting that some fraction of the more luminous sources occupy more massive halos as satellites, or are possibly close pairs. We measure the cross-correlation power spectra between bands, finding that bands which are farthest apart are the least correlated, as well as hints of a reduction in the correlation between bands when resolved sources are more aggressively masked. In the second part of the paper we attempt to interpret the measurements in the framework of the halo model. With the aim of fitting simultaneously with one model the power spectra, number counts, and absolute CIB level in all bands, we find that this is achievable by invoking a luminosity-mass relationship, such that the luminosity-to-mass ratio peaks at a particular halo mass scale and declines towards lower and higher mass halos. Our best-fit model finds that the halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation in the redshift range of peak star-forming activity, z {\~{}} 1-3, is log(M{\_}peak/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 12.1 +- 0.5, and that the minimum halo mass to host infrared galaxies is log(M{\_}min/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 10.1 +- 0.6.},

All of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range z = 2 to 6.5. The presence of the CIV absorption feature, indicating that the rest-frame UV-optical SED is dominated by OB stars, is used to select objects for which the intrinsic, unattenuated spectrum has a well-established shape. Comparison of this intrinsic spectrum with the observed broadband photometric SED then permits derivation of the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation. The derived dust attenuation curve is similar in overall shape to the Calzetti curve for local starburst galaxies. We also see the 2175 $\backslash$AA{\~{}}bump feature which is present in the Milky Way and LMC extinction curves but not seen in the Calzetti curve. The bump feature is commonly attributed to graphite or PAHs. No significant dependence is seen with redshift between sub-samples at z = 2 - 4 and z = 4 - 6.5. The 'extinction' curve obtained here provides a firm basis for color and extinction corrections of high redshift galaxy photometry.},

abstract = {We analyze very deep HST, VLT and Spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 in the Hubble Deep Field South. The sample is selected from the deepest public K-band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U-V vs V-J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U-V colors are generally red in rest-frame V-J as well. However, at a given U-V color a range in V-J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z{\textgreater}2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when adding IRAC data to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (U-V {\textgreater} 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue (U-V {\textless} 1) galaxies. We find a similar color-dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full near-infrared JHK coverage; if only K-band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z{\textgreater}2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U-V colors compared to lower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.},

In this paper, we describe the full details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey. We also present a public K-selected photometric catalog, along with accurate photometric redshifts. The redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in the COSMOS (AEGIS) fields, combining the NIR medium-bandwidth data with existing ultraviolet (UV; Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible and NIR (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subaru) and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC) imaging.

abstract = {Using observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we investigate the physical conditions of star-forming regions in {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies, specifically the electron density and ionization state. From measurements of the [O II]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}3726,3729 and [S II]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}6716,6731 doublets, we find a median electron density of {\$}\backslashsim250{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} at {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$}, an increase of an order of magnitude compared to measurements of galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}. While {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies are offset towards significantly higher O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$} values relative to local galaxies at fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similar distribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in the O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$} vs. R{\$}{\_}{\{}23{\}}{\$} and O3N2 diagrams. Based on these results, we propose that {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter as local galaxies at fixed metallicity. In combination with simple photoionization models, the position of local and {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies in excitation diagrams suggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizing spectrum at fixed metallicity from {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$}. We find that {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxies in emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [N II]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}6584. We conclude that the offset of {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [N II] BPT diagram is primarily driven by elevated N/O at fixed O/H compared to local galaxies. These results suggest that the local gas-phase and stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54{\%} for log (M sstarf) {\textgreater} 10 at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11{\%}), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7{\%}). The remaining 28{\%} comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of the core (r{\textless}1 kpc) and effective (r{\textless}r{\_}e) stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Since z=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma{\_}e) and log(Sigma{\_}1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter that remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For SFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both Sigma{\_}e and Sigma{\_}1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by growing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main sequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}e, Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same mass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}e declines by a factor of 10 since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1. Thus, the common denominator for quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar core, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for quenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1 at each redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped sequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and quenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative to that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and Sersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs reach a maximum central density above Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1 {\textgreater} 9.5 M{\_}sun/kpc{\^{}}2. This threshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the star-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.},

abstract = {We refine a technique to measure the absorption corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest frame UV quantities alone, and apply it to U-dropouts at z {\~{}} 3 found in the Hubble Deep Field. The method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (FIR) to UV fluxes with spectral slope $\backslash$beta (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation allows the UV flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-free UV luminosity to be determined. IUE spectra and IRAS fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 Angstrom absorption A{\_}{\{}1600{\}}, and the transformation from broad band color to $\backslash$beta. We show that the recent marginal and non-detections of HDF U-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm are consistent with our calculated A{\_}{\{}1600{\}}. This is also true of observations of the ratio of optical emission line flux to UV flux density in the brightest U-dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust extinction. In U-dropouts, absolute magnitude correlates with $\backslash$beta: brighter galaxies are redder, as is observed in local starburst galaxies. This suggests that a mass-metallicity relationship is in place by z {\~{}} 3. The UV luminosity function of U-dropouts extends up to M{\_}{\{}1600,0{\}} {\~{}} -24 ABmag corresponding to a star formation rate {\~{}} 200 $\backslash$Msun/yr (H{\_}0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q{\_}0 = 0.5).

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyse optical photometry and spectra of the extremely luminous and slowly evolving Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2009dc, and offer evidence that it is a super-Chandrasekhar mass (SC) SN Ia and thus had a SC white dwarf (WD) progenitor. Optical spectra of SN 2007if, a similar object, are also shown. SN 2009dc had one of the most slowly evolving light curves ever observed for a SN Ia, with a rise time of {\~{}}23 days and Delta m{\_}15(B) = 0.72 mag. We calculate a lower limit to the peak bolometric luminosity of {\~{}}2.4e43 erg/s, though the actual value is likely almost 40{\%} larger. Optical spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if obtained near maximum brightness exhibit strong C II features (indicative of a significant amount of unburned material), and the post-maximum spectra are dominated by iron-group elements. All of our spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if also show low expansion velocities. However, we see no strong evidence in SN 2009dc for a velocity "plateau" near maximum light like the one seen in SN 2007if (Scalzo et al. 2010). The high luminosity and low expansion velocities of SN 2009dc lead us to derive a possible WD progenitor mass of more than 2 M{\_}Sun and a Ni-56 mass of about 1.4-1.7 M{\_}Sun. We propose that the host galaxy of SN 2009dc underwent a gravitational interaction with a neighboring galaxy in the relatively recent past. This may have led to a sudden burst of star formation which could have produced the SC WD progenitor of SN 2009dc and likely turned the neighboring galaxy into a "post-starburst galaxy." No published model seems to match the extreme values observed in SN 2009dc, but simulations do show that such massive progenitors can exist (likely as a result of the merger of two WDs) and can possibly explode as SC SNe Ia.},

abstract = {The study of cosmology, galaxy formation and exoplanetary systems has now advanced to a stage where a cosmic inventory of terrestrial planets may be attempted. By coupling semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to a recipe that relates the occurrence of planets to the mass and metallicity of their host stars, we trace the population of terrestrial planets around both solar-mass (FGK type) and lower-mass (M dwarf) stars throughout all of cosmic history. We find that the mean age of terrestrial planets in the local Universe is {\$}8\backslashpm1{\$} Gyr and that the typical planet of this type is located in a spheroid-dominated galaxy with total stellar mass about twice that of the Milky Way. We estimate that hot Jupiters have depleted the population of terrestrial planets around FGK stars at redshift {\$}z=0{\$} by no more than {\$}\backslashapprox 10\backslash{\%}{\$}, and predict that {\$}\backslashapprox 1/3{\$} of the terrestrial planets in the local Universe are orbiting stars in a metallicity range for which such planets have yet to be been detected. When looking at the inventory of planets throughout the whole observable Universe (i.e. in all galaxies on our past light cone) we argue for a total of {\$}\backslashapprox 2\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashapprox 7\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}}{\$} terrestrial planets around FGK and M stars, respectively. Due to the hierarchical formation of galaxies and lookback-time effects, the average terrestrial planet on our past light cone has an age of just {\$}1.7\backslashpm 0.2{\$} Gyr and is sitting in a galaxy with a stellar mass a factor of {\$}\backslashapprox 2{\$} lower than that of the Milky Way. These results are discussed in the context of cosmic habitability, the Copernican principle and the prospects of searches for extraterrestrial intelligence at cosmological distances.},

abstract = {We study the relationship between stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR),ionization state, and gas-phase metallicity for a sample of 41 normal star-forming galaxies at {\$}3 \backslashlesssim z \backslashlesssim 3.7{\$}. The gas-phase oxygen abundance, ionization parameter, and electron density of ionized gas are derived from rest-frame optical strong emission lines measured on near-infrared spectra obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We remove the effect of these strong emission lines in the broad-band fluxes to compute stellar masses via spectral energy distribution fitting, while the SFR is derived from the dust-corrected ultraviolet luminosity. The ionization parameter is weakly correlated with the specific SFR, but otherwise the ionization parameter and electron density do not correlate with other global galaxy properties such as stellar mass, SFR, and metallicity. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at {\$}z\backslashsimeq3.3{\$} shows lower metallicity by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.7{\$} dex than that at {\$}z=0{\$} at the same stellar mass. Our sample shows an offset by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.3{\$} dex from the locally defined mass-metallicity-SFR relation, indicating that simply extrapolating such relation to higher redshift may predict an incorrect evolution of MZR. Furthermore, within the uncertainties we find no SFR-metallicity correlation, suggesting a less important role of SFR in controlling the metallicity at high redshift. We finally investigate the redshift evolution of the MZR by using the model by Lilly et al. (2013), finding that the observed evolution from {\$}z=0{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsimeq3.3{\$} can be accounted for by the model assuming a weak redshift evolution of the star formation efficiency.},

abstract = {We use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 from the GMASS survey to study different star formation rate (SFR) estimators. Infrared (IR) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correct ultraviolet (UV) and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities for dust extinction and dust-corrected estimates of SFR. In the selection procedure we fully exploit the available spectroscopic information. On the basis of three continuum indices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in which old stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to IR luminosity (LIR) and continuum reddening. Using Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS data we derive LIR for two-thirds of our sample. The LIR/LUV ratio is used as a probe of effective attenuation (AIRX) to search for correlations with continuum and spectroscopic features. The relation between AIRX and UV continuum slope ({\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with the literature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion with respect to UV-selected samples. We find a correlation between the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line and {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}, which is the main result of this work. We therefore propose the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line EW as a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through AIRX, though the assumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actual attenuation towards the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line. We tested the issue of differential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: our results are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuation towards nebular lines. A set of relations is provided that allows the recovery of the total unattenuated SFR from UV and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities. (Abridged)},

For z{\~{}}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities(L{\_}{\{}8um{\}}{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}sun), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However,20--30{\%} of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L{\_}{\{}8um{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}sun, show a mid-IR excess which is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24um-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of {\~{}}4 and {\~{}}30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively 'transparent' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ({\~{}}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4, and the space density of ULIRGs by an orderof magnitude, but give better agreement for z{\textgreater}1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

abstract = {For low-redshift cosmology and galaxy formation rates, it is important to account for all the baryons synthesized in the Big Bang. Although galaxies and clusters contain 10{\%} of the baryons, many more reside in the photoionized Lyman-alpha forest and shocked-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at T = 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}7 K. Current tracers of WHIM at 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}6 K include the O VI 1032, 1038 absorption lines, together with broad Lyman-alpha absorbers (BLAs) and EUV/X-ray absorption lines from Ne VIII, O VII, and O VIII. We improve the O VI baryon surveys with corrections for oxygen metallicity (Z/Zsun) and O VI ionization fraction (f{\_}OVI) using cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport in a density-temperature structured medium. Statistically, their product correlates with column density, (Z/Zsun)(f{\_}OVI) = (0.015)(N{\_}OVI/10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} cm{\^{}}-2){\^{}}0.70. The N{\_}OVI-weighted mean is 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also reanalyze H I data from the Hubble Space Telescope, applying redshift corrections for absorber density, photoionizing background, and proper length, dl/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lya forest (28 +/- 11{\%}), O VI/BLA-traced WHIM (25 +/- 8{\%}), and collapsed phase (18 +/- 4{\%}) in galaxies, groups, clusters, and circumgalactic gas. The baryon shortfall is 29 +/- 13{\%}, which may be detected in X-ray absorbers from hotter WHIM or in weaker Lya and O VI absorbers.

abstract = {Context. Our Local Group of galaxies appears to be moving relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background with the source of the peculiar motion still uncertain. While in the past this has been studied mostly using galaxies as distance indicators, the weight of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has increased recently with the continuously improving statistics of available low-redshift supernovae. Aims. We measured the bulk flow in the nearby universe (0.015 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1) using 117 SNe Ia observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory, as well as the Union2 compilation of SN Ia data already in the literature. Methods. The bulk flow velocity was determined from SN data binned in redshift shells by including a coherent motion (dipole) in a cosmological fit. Additionally, a method of spatially smoothing the Hubble residuals was used to verify the results of the dipole fit. To constrain the location and mass of a potential mass concentration (e.g. the Shapley Supercluster) responsible for the peculiar motion, we fit a Hubble law modified by adding an additional mass concentration. Results. The analysis shows a bulk flow consistent with the direction of the CMB dipole up to z {\~{}} 0.06, thereby doubling the volume over which conventional distance measures have sensitivity to a bulk flow. We see no significant turnover behind the center of the Shapley Supercluster. A simple attractor model in the proximity of the Shapley Supercluster is only marginally consistent with our data, suggesting the need for another, more distant, source. In the redshift shell 0.06 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1, we constrain the bulk flow velocity to {\textless} 240 km/s (68{\%} confidence level) for the direction of the CMB dipole, in contradiction to recent claims of the existence of a large amplitude dark flow.},

The KBSS-MOSFIRE sample is representative of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, with stellar masses M*=10{\^{}}9-10{\^{}}11.5 M{\_}sun and star formation rates SFR=3-1000 M{\_}sun/yr.

Comparisons with observations of typical local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and between subsamples of KBSS-MOSFIRE show that high-redshift galaxies exhibit a number of significant differences in addition to the well-known offset in log([O III]/H-beta) and log([N II]/H-alpha). We argue that the primary difference between H II regions in z{\~{}}2.3 galaxies and those at z{\~{}}0 is an enhancement in the degree of nebular excitation, as measured by [O III]/H-beta and R23=log[([O III]+[O II])/H-beta].

The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z {\~{}} 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 $\mu$m, 14{\%} remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

As in 1991bg-like SNe Ia at comparable epochs, the spectrum is characterised by relatively broad [FeII] and [CaII] emission lines. However, instead of narrow [FeIII] and [CoIII] lines that dominate the emission from the innermost regions of 1991bg-like SNe, SN 2010lp shows [OI] 6300,6364 emission, usually associated with core-collapse SNe and never observed in a subluminous thermonuclear explosion before. The [OI] feature has a complex profile with two strong, narrow emission peaks. This suggests oxygen to be distributed in a non-spherical region close to the centre of the ejecta, severely challenging most thermonuclear explosion models discussed in the literature. We conclude that given these constraints violent mergers are presently the most promising scenario to explain SN 2010lp.},

abstract = {We present results on the spectral decomposition of 118 Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra from local active galactic nuclei (AGN) using a large set of Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates. The templates are themselves IRS spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar, interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented fidelity for a template fitting method, with no need to model extinction separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations. We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches the nuclear spectrum, with a 1-sigma dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and typical uncertainties of {\~{}}0.19 in the spectral index and {\~{}}0.1 in the silicate strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably removed from the IRS spectra of AGN. This allows for unbiased studies of the AGN emission in intermediate and high redshift galaxies -currently inaccesible to ground-based observations- with archival Spitzer/IRS data and in the future with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope.

abstract = {In this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposure of the Chandra Deep$\backslash$n Field South (CDFS), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on the Chandra X-ray$\backslash$n Observatory. Eleven individual pointings made between 1999 October and 2000 December were combined$\backslash$n to generate the final image used for object detection. Catalog generation proceeded simultaneously$\backslash$n using two different methods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the SExtractor$\backslash$n algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra observations. The$\backslash$n detection threshold has been set in order to have less than 10 spurious sources, as assessed by$\backslash$n extensive simulations. We subdivided the catalog into four sections. The primary list consists of$\backslash$n objects common to the two detection methods. Two secondary lists contain sources which were detected$\backslash$n by (1) the SExtractor algorithm alone and (2) the wavelet technique alone. The fourth list consists$\backslash$n of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5-2 keV)$\backslash$n and hard (2-10 keV) bands are 5.5 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 and 4.5 × 10 -16 erg s -1 cm -2 ,$\backslash$n respectively. The total number of sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5-2 keV$\backslash$n band, and 251 in the 2-10 keV band.$\backslash$n $\backslash$n      We also present optical identifications for the cataloged sources. Our primary optical data are$\backslash$n R band imaging from VLT/FORS1 to a depth of R {\~{}} 26.5 (Vega). In regions of the field not covered by$\backslash$n the VLT/FORS1 deep imaging, we use R -band data obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the$\backslash$n ESO-MPI 2.2 m telescope, as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), which cover the entire X-ray$\backslash$n survey. We found that the FORS1/ Chandra offsets are small, {\~{}}1''.

abstract = {We present six galaxies at z{\~{}}2 that show evidence of Lyman continuum (LyC) emission based on the newly acquired UV imaging of the Hubble Deep UV legacy survey (HDUV) conducted with the WFC3/UVIS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). At the redshift of these sources, the HDUV F275W images partially probe the ionizing continuum. By exploiting the HST multi-wavelength data available in the HDUV/GOODS fields, models of the UV spectral energy distributions, and detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium absorption, we estimate the absolute ionizing photon escape fractions of these galaxies to be very high -- typically {\textgreater}60{\%} ({\textgreater}13{\%} for all sources at 90{\%} likelihood). Our findings are in broad agreement with previous studies that found only a small fraction of galaxies to show high escape fraction. These six galaxies comprise the largest sample yet of LyC leaking candidates at z{\~{}}2 whose inferred LyC flux has been cleanly observed at HST resolution. While three of our six candidates show evidence of hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN), two of these are heavily obscured and their LyC emission appears to originate from star-forming regions rather than the central nucleus. This suggests an AGN-aided pathway for LyC escape from these sources. Extensive multi-wavelength data in the GOODS fields, especially the near-IR grism spectra from the 3D-HST survey, enable us to study the candidates in detail and tentatively test some recently proposed indirect methods to probe LyC leakage -- namely, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio and the H{\$}\backslashbeta-{\$}UV slope diagram. High-resolution spectroscopic followup of our candidates will help constrain such indirect methods which are our only hope of studying {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}{\$} at z{\~{}}5-9 in the fast-approaching era of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {We present the results of the first, deep ALMA imaging covering the full 4.5 sq arcmin of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) as previously imaged with WFC3/IR on HST. Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous 1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a resolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of {\~{}}50 {\textgreater}3.5sigma peaks, a rigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) {\textgreater} 120 microJy. All of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts ({\textless}z{\textgreater} = 2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging. Due to the wealth of supporting data in this unique field, the physical properties of the ALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and UV+FIR star-formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the best predictor of SFR in the high-z Universe; indeed at z {\textgreater} 2 our ALMA sample contains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the HUDF with M* {\textgreater} 2 x 10{\^{}}10 Msun and we detect only one galaxy at z {\textgreater} 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies with increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to probe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S(1.3) {\~{}} 10 micro-Jy. We find strong evidence for a steep `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, with SFR $\backslash$propto M* and a mean specific SFR = 2.2 /Gyr. Moreover, we find that {\~{}}85{\%} of total star formation at z {\~{}} 2 is enshrouded in dust, with {\~{}}65{\%} of all star formation at this epoch occurring in high-mass galaxies (M* {\textgreater} 2 x 10{\^{}}10 Msun), for which the average obscured:unobscured SF ratio is {\~{}}200. Finally, we combine our new ALMA results with the existing HST data to revisit the cosmic evolution of star-formation rate density; we find that this peaks at z {\~{}} 2.5, and that the star-forming Universe transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured thereafter at z {\~{}} 4.},

abstract = {We present a comparison of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) parallaxes with photometric parallaxes for a sample of 212 Galactic Cepheids at a median distance of 2{\~{}}kpc, and explore their implications on the distance scale and the local value of the Hubble constant H{\_}0. The Cepheid distances are estimated from a recent calibration of the near-infrared Period-Luminosity P-L relation. The comparison is carried out in parallax space, where the DR1 parallax errors, with a median value of half the median parallax, are expected to be well-behaved. With the exception of one outlier, the DR1 parallaxes are in remarkably good global agreement with the predictions, and the published errors may be conservatively overestimated by about 20{\%}. The parallaxes of 9 Cepheids brighter than G = 6 may be systematically underestimated, trigonometric parallaxes measured with the HST FGS for three of these objects confirm this trend. If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities and assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes would imply a decrease of 0.3{\%} in the current estimate of the local Hubble constant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a value 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value inferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM. We also test for a zeropoint error in Gaia parallaxes and find none to a precision of {\~{}}20 muas. We caution however that with this early release, the complete systematic properties of the measurements may not be fully understood at the statistical level of the Cepheid sample mean, a level an order of magnitude below the individual uncertainties. The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the enormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions in astrophysics and cosmology.},

@article{Chevallard2013,
abstract = {We present a new approach to investigate the content and spatial distribution of dust in structurally unresolved star-forming galaxies from the observed dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy inclination. Motivated by the observation that different stellar populations reside in different spatial components of nearby star-forming galaxies, we develop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer in dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, via the association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars in different age ranges. We start by showing that a wide range of radiative transfer models all predict a quasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at any wavelength, from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper (shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and Milky Way curves at small (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry and orientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuation curve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains. We use our new, combined radiative transfer and spectral evolution model to interpret the observed dependence of the Halpha/Hbeta ratio and ugrizYJH attenuation curve on inclination in a sample of about 23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies, which we correct for systematic biases by developing a general method based on importance sampling. From the exploration of the model parameter space by means of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we measure the central face-on B-band optical depth of this sample to be tauB⊥ ≈ 1.8 ± 0.2 (corresponding to an angle-averaged {\{}{\textless} hat{\{}tau{\}}{\^{}}ISM{\_}V{\textgreater} {\_}theta {\}}≈ 0.3). We also quantify the enhanced optical depth towards newly formed stars in their birth clouds, finding this to be significantly larger in galaxies with bulges than in disc-dominated galaxies, while tauB⊥ is roughly similar in both cases. This can arise if, for example, galaxies with significant bulges have higher central star formation efficiencies than their disc-dominated counterparts at a fixed specific star formation rate, and dustier stellar birth clouds because of the higher metallicity. We find that over 80 per cent of the attenuation in galaxies in our sample is characteristic of that affecting thin-disc stars in radiative transfer models. The median unattenuated V-band luminosity ratio of thick-disc to thin-disc stars is 0.1-0.2, in good agreement with the results from spatially resolved studies of nearby edge-on disc galaxies. Finally, we show that neglecting the effect of geometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the interpretation of galaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on broad-band colours can reach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and 0.1 mag at near-infrared ones. This paper also contains an original application of Gaussian random processes to extend the wavelength range of dust attenuation curves.},

We combine imaging from three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (ZFOURGE/CANDELS, UDS, and UltraVISTA), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample of satellites with {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}sat{\}}{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textgreater}9.3{\$}. Satellites for both star-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractions compared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also observe "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are more likely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals. In our sample, this conformity signal is significant at {\$}\backslashgtrsim3\backslashsigma{\$} for {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.6{\$}, whereas it is only weakly significant at {\$}0.3{\textless}z{\textless}0.6{\$} and {\$}1.6{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. Therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has been present for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite quenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but does not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass limit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of star-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent centrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity signal decreases, but remains statistically significant at {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$}. This is evidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation properties of the central as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects that may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow for continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are quenched.},

abstract = {We analyze the monopole in the peculiar velocities of 44 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to test for a local void. The sample extends from 20 to 300 Mpc/h, with distances, deduced from light-curve shapes, accurate to {\~{}}6{\%}. Assuming Omega{\_}m=1 and Omega{\_}lambda=0, the most significant deviation we find from the Hubble law is an outwards flow of (6.6+/-2.2){\%} inside a sphere of radius 70 Mpc/h as would be produced by a void of {\~{}}20{\%} underdensity surrounded by a dense shell. This shell roughly coincides with the local Great Walls. Monte Carlo analyses, using Gaussian errors or bootstrap resampling, show the probability for chance occurrence of this result out of a pure Hubble flow to be {\~{}}2{\%}. The monopole could be contaminated by higher moments of the velocity field, especially a quadrupole, which are not properly probed by the current limited sky coverage. The void would be less significant if Omega{\_}m is low and Omega{\_}lambda is high. It would be more significant if one outlier is removed from the sample, or if the size of the void is constrained a-priori. This putative void is not in significant conflict with any of the standard cosmological scenarios. It suggests that the Hubble constant as determined within 70 Mpc/h could be overestimated by {\~{}}6{\%} and the local value of Omega may be underestimated by {\~{}}20{\%}. While the present evidence for a local void is marginal in this data set, the analysis shows that the accumulation of SNe Ia distances will soon provide useful constraints on elusive and important aspects of regional cosmic dynamics.},

SN 2002cx exhibits a SN 1991T-like premaximum spectrum, a SN 1991bg-like luminosity, and expansion velocities roughly half those of normal SNe Ia. Photometrically, SN 2002cx has a broad peak in the {\$}R{\$} band and a plateau phase in the {\$}I{\$} band, and slow late-time decline. The {\$}(B - V){\$} color evolution is nearly normal, but the {\$}(V - R){\$} and {\$}(V - I){\$} colors are very red. Early-time spectra of SN 2002cx evolve very quickly and are dominated by lines from Fe-group elements; features from intermediate-mass elements (Ca, S, Si) are weak or absent. Mysterious emission lines are observed around 7000 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ at about 3 weeks after maximum brightness. The nebular spectrum of SN 2002cx is also unique, consisting of narrow iron and cobalt lines. The observations of SN 2002cx are inconsistent with the observed spectral/photometric sequence, and provide a major challenge to our understanding of SNe Ia. No existing theoretical model can successfully explain all observed aspects of SN 2002cx.},

abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 $\mu$m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at $\lambda${\textgreater}{\~{}}40 $\mu$m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\~{}}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\~{}}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60{\%} of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\~{}}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 $\mu$m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 $\mu$m is {\~{}}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40{\%} larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 $\mu$m is less than 15{\%} of the FIR energy. On average, about 30{\%} of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\~{}}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20{\%} when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

We denote the bands {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}u{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}g{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}i{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}z{\}}, with $\backslash$lambda{\_}{\{}eff{\}} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111] Angstroms respectively. We use a maximum likelihood method which allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc{\^{}}3 of [-14.10 $\backslash$pm 0.15, -15.18 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -15.90 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.24 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.56 $\backslash$pm 0.02] in [{\{}0.1{\}}{\{}u{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}g{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}i{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}z{\}}], respectively, using $\backslash$Omega{\_}0 =0.3, $\backslash$Omega{\_}$\backslash$Lambda=0.7, and h=1, and using Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using Sersic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}} band, the best fit Schechter function to our results has $\backslash$phi{\_}$\backslash$ast = (1.49 $\backslash$pm 0.04) $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} h{\^{}}3 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, M{\_}$\backslash$ast - 5$\backslash$log{\_}{\{}10{\}} h = -20.44 $\backslash$pm 0.01, and $\backslash$alpha = -1.05$\backslash$pm 0.01.

Our results are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millenium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change ($\backslash$sim 0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model.},

Our suite includes both isolated disk galaxies and mergers intended to be representative of galaxies at both {\$}z \backslashsim 0{\$} and {\$}z \backslashsim 2-3{\$}. Our low-redshift isolated disks and mergers often populate a region around the the locally calibrated $\backslash$citet[][M99]{\{}M99{\}} relation but move well above the relation during merger-induced starbursts. Our high-redshift simulated galaxies are blue and IR-luminous, which makes them lie above the M99 relation. The value of UV continuum slope strongly depends on the dust type used in the radiative transfer calculations: Milky Way-type dust leads to significantly more negative (bluer) slopes compared with Small Magellanic Cloud-type dust. The effect on {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} due to variations in the dust composition with galaxy properties or redshift can dominate over other sources of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} variations and is the dominant model uncertainty. The dispersion in {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} is anticorrelated with specific star formation rate and tends to be higher for the {\$}z \backslashsim 2-3{\$} simulations. In the actively star-forming {\$}z \backslashsim 2-3{\$} simulated galaxies, dust attenuation dominates the dispersion in {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}, whereas in the {\$}z \backslashsim 0{\$} simulations, the contributions of SFH variations and dust are similar. For low-SSFR systems at both redshifts, SFH variations dominate the dispersion. Finally, the simulated {\$}z \backslashsim 2-3{\$} isolated disks and mergers both occupy a region in the $\backslash$irxbeta$\backslash$ plane consistent with observed {\$}z \backslashsim 2-3{\$} dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Thus, contrary to some claims in the literature, the blue colors of high-z DSFGs do not imply that they are short-lived starbursts.},

Our primary interest is to improve the constraints on the total IR luminosities, L(IR), of these galaxies. We combine the Spitzer data in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field with a K-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile. We used a stacking analysis to measure the average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 galaxies as a function of 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR color. Galaxies with 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 and S(24)=53-250 micro-Jy have L(IR) derived from their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of those derived from the 24 micron flux densities only. However, L(IR) derived from the average 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with S(24) {\textgreater} 250 micro-Jy and 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron flux density by factors of 2-10. Galaxies with S(24) {\textgreater} 250 micro-Jy have S(70)/S(24) flux ratios comparable to sources with X-ray detections or red rest-frame IR colors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by AGN may contribute to the high 24 micron emission. Based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities, nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 have L(IR) {\textless} 6 x 10{\^{}}12 solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to {\textless} 1000 solar masses per year. This suggests that high redshift galaxies may have similar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.

abstract = {We examine how HI and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halos trace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model for galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several Gyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass halos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.},

abstract = {We present optical and infrared observations of the unusual Type Ia supernova (SN) 2004eo. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of the prototypical SN 1992A, and the luminosity at maximum (M{\_}B = -19.08) is close to the average for a SN Ia. However, the ejected 56Ni mass derived by modelling the bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limit of the 56Ni mass distribution observed in normal SNe Ia. Accordingly, SN 2004eo shows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (Delta m{\_}(B) = 1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio Si II 5972 / Si II 6355 similar to that of SN 1992A. The physical properties of SN 2004eo cause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocity gradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by Benetti et al. (2005). Similar behaviour is seen in a few other SNe Ia. Thus, there may in fact exist a few SNe Ia with intermediate physical properties.},

@article{Cappellari2011,
abstract = {We look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies. Edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with disky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [f(SR){\textless}2{\%}] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR){\~{}}4{\%}] of the total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR){\~{}}20{\%}]. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the fraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We present Early Science observations with the Large Millimeter Telescope, AzTEC 1.1 mm continuum images and wide bandwidth spectra (73-111 GHz) acquired with the Redshift Search Receiver, towards four bright lensed submillimetre galaxies identified through the Herschel Lensing Survey-snapshot and the SCUBA-2 Cluster Snapshot Survey. This pilot project studies the star formation history and the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust content of the highest redshift galaxies identified through the benefits of gravitational magnification. We robustly detect dust continuum emission for the full sample and CO emission lines for three of the targets. We find that one source shows spectroscopic multiplicity and is a blend of three galaxies at different redshifts (z=2.040, 3.252 and 4.680), reminiscent of previous high-resolution imaging follow-up of unlensed submillimetre galaxies, but with a completely different search method, that confirm recent theoretical predictions of physically unassociated blended galaxies. Identifying the detected lines as 12CO (J{\_}up=2-5) we derive spectroscopic redshifts, molecular gas masses, and dust masses from the continuum emission. The mean H{\_}2 gas mass of the full sample is (2.0 +- 0.2) x 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, and the mean dust mass is (2.0+-0.2) x 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, where $\backslash$mu=2-5 is the expected lens amplification. Using these independent estimations we infer a gas-to-dust ratio of $\backslash$delta{\_}GDR=55-75, in agreement with other measurements of submillimetre galaxies. Our magnified high-luminosity galaxies fall on the same locus as other high-redshift submillimetre galaxies, extending the L'{\_}CO - L{\_}FIR correlation observed for local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies to higher FIR and CO luminosities.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic life requires sufficient photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to metabolise. On Earth, plant behaviour, physiology and metabolism are sculpted around the night-day cycle by an endogenous biological circadian clock. The evolution of life was influenced by the Earth-Sun orbital dynamic, which generates the photo-environment incident on the planetary surface. In this work the unusual photo-environment of an Earth-like planet (ELP) in 3:2 spin orbit resonance is explored. Photo-environments on the ELP are longitudinally differentiated, in addition to differentiations relating to latitude and depth (for aquatic organisms) which are familiar on Earth. The light environment on such a planet could be compatible with Earth's photosynthetic life although the threat of atmospheric freeze-out and prolonged periods of darkness would present significant challenges. We emphasise the relationship between the evolution of life on a planetary body with its orbital dynamics.},

We derive differential abundances of 21 elements relative to the Sun with precisions as high as 0.004 dex ({\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}1{\%}), using ultra high-resolution (R = 110,000), high S/N UVES spectra obtained on the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope. Our determined metallicity of HIP 102152 is [Fe/H] = -0.013 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.004. The atmospheric parameters of the star were determined to be 54 K cooler than the Sun, 0.09 dex lower in surface gravity, and a microturbulence identical to our derived solar value. Elemental abundance ratios examined vs. dust condensation temperature reveal a solar abundance pattern for this star, in contrast to most solar twins. The abundance pattern of HIP 02152 appears to be the most similar to solar of any known solar twin. Abundances of the younger, 2.9 Gyr solar twin, 18 Sco, were also determined from UVES spectra to serve as a comparison for HIP 102152. The solar chemical pattern of HIP 102152 makes it a potential candidate to host terrestrial planets, which is reinforced by the lack of giant planets in its terrestrial planet region. The following non-local thermodynamic equilibrium Li abundances were obtained for HIP 102152, 18 Sco, and the Sun: log {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} (Li) = 0.48 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.07, 1.62 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.02, and 1.07 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.02, respectively. The Li abundance of HIP 102152 is the lowest reported to date for a solar twin, and allows us to consider an emerging, tightly constrained Li-age trend for solar twin stars.},

abstract = {The rest-frame ultraviolet properties of galaxies during the first three billion years of cosmic time (redshift z {\textgreater} 4) indicate a rapid evolution in the dust obscuration of such galaxies. This evolution implies a change in the average properties of the interstellar medium, but the measurements are systematically uncertain owing to untested assumptions and the inability to detect heavily obscured regions of the galaxies. Previous attempts to measure the interstellar medium directly in normal galaxies at these redshifts have failed for a number of reasons, with two notable exceptions. Here we report measurements of the forbidden C ii emission (that is, [C II]) from gas, and the far-infrared emission from dust, in nine typical star-forming galaxies about one billion years after the Big Bang (z ≈ 5-6). We find that these galaxies have thermal emission that is less than 1/12 that of similar systems about two billion years later, and enhanced [C II] emission relative to the far-infrared continuum, confirming a strong evolution in the properties of the interstellar medium in the early Universe. The gas is distributed over scales of one to eight kiloparsecs, and shows diverse dynamics within the sample. These results are consistent with early galaxies having significantly less dust than typical galaxies seen at z {\textless} 3 and being comparable in dust content to local low-metallicity systems.},

abstract = {We present a family of six BVI template light curves for SNe Ia for days -5 and +80, based on high-quality data gathered at CTIO. These templates display a wide range of light curve morphologies, with initial decline rates of their B light curves between m15(B)=0.87 mag and 1.93 mag. We use these templates to study the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of the main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with m15(B). In particular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good approximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in shapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the least-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed spectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one parameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show significant differences in their light curve properties when examined in detail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.},

abstract = {We study the effects of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems in the COSMOS field at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 3. We show that at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, the median star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on environment, but they become independent of environment at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1. However, we find that only for $\backslash$textit{\{}star-forming{\}} galaxies, the median SFR and sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and stellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, and on stellar mass out to {\$}z\backslashsim{\$} 3. We show that at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that the overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time. Environmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency ({\$}\backslashepsilon{\_}{\{}mass{\}}{\$}) for more massive galaxies (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.2) rises with cosmic time until {\$}z\backslashsim{\$} 1 and flattens out since then. However, for less massive galaxies, the rise in {\$}\backslashepsilon{\_}{\{}mass{\}}{\$} continues to the present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only relevant at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the dominant mechanism at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega{\_}M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega{\_}Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega{\_}M - 0.6 Omega{\_}Lambda {\~{}}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega{\_}M {\textless}{\~{}} 1.5). For a flat (Omega{\_}M + Omega{\_}Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega{\_}M = 0.28{\{}+0.09,-0.08{\}} (1 sigma statistical) {\{}+0.05,-0.04{\}} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99{\%}, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t{\_}0 = 14.9{\{}+1.4,-1.1{\}} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

abstract = {We present the first direct calibration of strong-line metallicity diagnostics at significant cosmological distances using a sample at z=0.8 drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Oxygen and neon abundances are derived from measurements of electron temperature and density. We directly compare various commonly used relations between gas-phase metallicity and strong line ratios of O, Ne, and H at z=0.8 and z=0. There is no evolution with redshift at high precision ({\$}\backslashDelta \backslashlog{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}O/H{\}}{\}} = -0.01\backslashpm0.03{\$}, {\$}\backslashDelta \backslashlog{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ne/O{\}}{\}} = 0.01 \backslashpm 0.01{\$}). O, Ne, and H line ratios follow the same locus at z=0.8 as at z=0 with {\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}0.02 dex evolution and low scatter ({\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}0.04 dex). We speculate that offsets observed in the [N II]/H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} versus [O III]/H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} diagram at high redshift are therefore due to [N II] emission, likely as a result of relatively high N/O abundance. If this is indeed the case, then nitrogen-based metallicity diagnostics suffer from systematic errors at high redshift. Our findings indicate that locally calibrated abundance diagnostics based on alpha-capture elements can be reliably applied at z{\$}\backslashsimeq{\$}1 and possibly at much higher redshifts.},

Here, we report the identification of a circumstellar disk that resulted from the destruction of a water-rich and rocky, extrasolar minor planet. The parent body formed and evolved around a star somewhat more massive than the Sun, and the debris now closely orbits the white dwarf remnant of the star. The stellar atmosphere is polluted with metals accreted from the disk, including oxygen in excess of that expected for oxide minerals, indicating the parent body was originally composed of 26{\%} water by mass. This finding demonstrates that water-bearing planetesimals exist around A- and F-type stars that end their lives as white dwarfs.},

By integrating the whole planet flux with and without impact spots, the effect of the impacts at wavelengths from 2 - 4 microns is revealed. Jupiter's reflected light spectrum in the near-infrared is dominated by its methane opacity including a deep band at 2.3 microns. After the impact, sunlight that would have normally been absorbed by the large amount of methane in Jupiter's atmosphere was instead reflected by the cometary material from the impacts. As a result, at 2.3 microns, where the planet would normally have low reflectivity, it brightened substantially and stayed brighter for at least a month.},

abstract = {We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328 Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened "standard" stars. This technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sightline.},

The H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux is inferred based on the offset between the IRAC 3.6 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m flux and that predicted from the best-fit SED. We demonstrate that the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation rate (SFR) and therefore can serve as an independent SFR indicator. However, we also find a systematic offset in the SFR{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR{\_}UV ratios for z {\~{}} 4-5 galaxies relative to local relations (assuming the same dust corrections for nebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest tension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing the dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low metallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the L{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR ratio). Using H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} as a SFR indicator, we find a higher normalization of the star formation main sequence compared to recent SED-based determinations and also derive the SFR functions at z {\~{}} 4-8. In addition, we assess for the first time the burstiness of star formation in z {\~{}} 4 galaxies on {\textless}100 Myr time scales by comparing UV and H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}-based sSFRs; their one-to-one relationship argues against significantly bursty star-formation histories. Further progress will be made on these results, by incorporating new results from ALMA to constrain the dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift UV-selected samples.},

abstract = {We present new improved constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) in the redshift range 0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopic evolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. We extract a large sample of early-type galaxies ($\backslash$sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys, spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.42). We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez {\&} Loeb (2002), whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see Tab. 4), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12{\%} mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z $\backslash$sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z $\backslash$neq 0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6{\%} at z $\backslash$sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a $\backslash$Lambda CDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g. Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z $\backslash$sim 2.},

This structure was selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera colors, satisfying ([3.6] - [4.5])AB{\textgreater} - 0.1 mag. Photometric redshifts derived from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey (BViz bands), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS, JK bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 $\mu$m) show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ≈ 1.6 that is {\textgreater}20$\sigma$ above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range z = 1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin ({\textless}1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4$\sigma$) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in this cluster shows a prominent red sequence, dominated by a population of red galaxies with (z - J){\textgreater}1.7 mag. The photometric-redshift probability distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z = 1.62, coincident with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U - B) color and scatter of galaxies on the red sequence are consistent with a mean luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 ± 0.1 Gyr, yielding a formation redshift $\backslash$overline{\{}z{\_}f{\}}=2.35 ± 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star formation period in these galaxies. This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407. This paper also includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. This work is based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

abstract = {We study the expansion of the nearby Universe using a sample of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts below 0.08. These supernovae allow peculiar velocities to be measured at unprecedented precision. We have investigated in detail the possibility of a varying Hubble constant with redshift and found no evidence of a monopole term for the nearby Universe. A large scale streaming motion is found at an amplitude of about {\$}340{\^{}}{\{}63{\}}{\_}{\{}-71{\}}{\$} km/sec, aligned in the direction of {\$}(l{\_}0, b{\_}0) = (312{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm o{\}}.0{\^{}}{\{}13.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-7.4{\}}, 25{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm o{\}}.7{\^{}}{\{}8.0{\}}{\_}{\{}-9.2{\}}){\$}, which is close to the direction of the center of Shapley supercluster of galaxies. The large scale streaming motion is best fit by a function involving a strong bipolar term. The streaming velocity field extends from the lowest redshift ({\$}\backslashsim 0.007{\$}) to beyond 0.025 and likely out to even higher redshifts. The velocity field at redshift below 0.01 can be equally well described by a dipole field or by the same bipolar streaming velocity field that reaches out to beyond {\$}z \backslashsim 0.025{\$}. We are also able to deduce a robust estimate of the random velocity component of the peculiar velocity field. Within the volume of redshift below 0.01 (weighted average redshift of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.067), this thermal component is found to be about 270 km/sec. After correcting this smooth streaming motion, we are able to significantly improve the Hubble expansion fits of these supernovae. The CMAGIC method gives a dramatic decrease of {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} from 90 to 63 for 69 degrees of freedom, and yields a residual scatter of only 0.12 magnitude; the maximum light method gives also a moderate improvement.},

abstract = {The dust extinction curve is a critical component of many observational programs and an important diagnostic of the physics of the interstellar medium. Here we present new measurements of the dust extinction curve and its variation towards tens of thousands of stars, a hundred-fold larger sample than in existing detailed studies. We use data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey in combination with ten-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE. We find that the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is more uniform than suggested in past works, with sigma(R(V)) = 0.18, and with less than one percent of sight lines having R(V) {\textgreater} 4. Our data and analysis have revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds, indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in dense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no correlation between R(V) and dust column density up to E(B-V) {\~{}} 2. Second, we discover a strong relationship between R(V) and the far-infrared dust emissivity.},

The imaging has a typical Ktots,AB limit of 24.3 mag (5 $\sigma$) and coverage over 113 arcmin2 in all bands and 138 arcmin2 in all bands but H. We cross-correlate our catalog with the 1 Ms X-ray catalog by Giacconi et al. (2002) and with all available spectroscopic redshifts to date. We find and explain systematic differences in a comparison with the ``z850+Ks''-selected GOODS-MUSIC catalog that covers {\~{}}90{\%} of the field. We exploit the U38-to-24 $\mu$m photometry to determine which Ks-selected galaxies at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 have the brightest total IR luminosities and which galaxies contribute most to the integrated total IR emission. The answer to both questions is that red galaxies are dominating in the IR. This is true no matter whether color is defined in the rest-frame UV, optical, or optical-near-IR. We do find, however, that among the reddest galaxies in the rest-frame optical, there is a population of sources with only little mid-IR emission, suggesting a quiescent nature.},

abstract = {We present the deepest far-IR observations obtained with Herschel and examine the 3-500um SEDs of galaxies at 0{\textless}z{\textless}2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and AKARI data. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, IR8 (=Lir/L8), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8=4 and defines an IR main sequence (MS). A minority population ({\textless}20 {\%}) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8 consist of starbursts (SB) with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact SBs with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness ({\textgreater}3x10{\^{}}10 Lsun kpc{\^{}}-2) and a high specific SFR (i.e., SBs). The rest-frame, UV-2700A size of these distant SBs is typically half that of MS galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and SB activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, (U)LIRGs are systematically in the SB mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the "normal" MS mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called "mid-IR excess" population of galaxies found at z{\textgreater}1.5 by previous studies. MS galaxies have strong PAH emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust{\~{}}15-50 K), and an effective Tdust{\~{}}31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their IR SED. Galaxies in the SB regime instead exhibit weak PAH EW and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust{\~{}}40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray AGNs is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty SBs. After correcting for the effect of SBs on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.},

This implies {\~{}}10{\%} have a satellite within the distance of the LMC, and {\~{}}40{\%} of L* galaxies host a bright satellite within the virialized extent of their dark matter halos. Remarkably, the simulation reproduces the observed frequency, radial dependence, velocity distribution, and luminosity function of observed secondaries exceptionally well, suggesting that LCDM provides an accurate reproduction of the observed Universe to galaxies as faint as L{\~{}}10{\^{}}9 Lsun on {\~{}}50 kpc scales. When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity dispersion of these satellites is sigma{\~{}}160 km/s, in agreement with abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single bright satellite. This redness trend is in stark contrast to the Milky Way's LMC, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy. We suggest that the LMC's discrepant color might be further evidence that it is undergoing a triggered star-formation event upon first infall.},

A $\chi$2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([O II], H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and Ly$\alpha$) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., $\Delta$z = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of $\sigma${\_}{\{}$\Delta$ z/(1+z{\_}s){\}}=0.007 at i + AB {\textless} 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields.

abstract = {This paper presents new deep and wide narrow-band surveys undertaken with United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), Subaru and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), a unique combined effort to select large, robust samples of H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23 (corresponding to look-back times of 4.2, 7.0, 9.2 and 10.6 Gyr) in a uniform manner over ˜2 deg2 in the Cosmological Evolution Survey and Ultra Deep Survey fields. The deep multi-epoch H$\alpha$ surveys reach a matched 3$\sigma$ flux limit of ≈3 M⊙ yr-1 out to z = 2.2 for the first time, while the wide area and the coverage over two independent fields allow us to greatly overcome cosmic variance and assemble by far the largest samples of H$\alpha$ emitters. Catalogues are presented for a total of 1742, 637, 515 and 807 H$\alpha$ emitters, robustly selected at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and its evolution. The faint-end slope of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function is found to be $\alpha$ = -1.60 ± 0.08 over z = 0-2.23, showing no significant evolution. The characteristic luminosity of star-forming galaxies, L*H$\alpha$, evolves significantly as log L*H$\alpha$(z) = 0.45z + log L*z = 0. This is the first time H$\alpha$ has been used to trace star formation activity with a single homogeneous survey at z = 0.4-2.23. Overall, the evolution seen with H$\alpha$ is in good agreement with the evolution seen using inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as far-infrared and ultraviolet, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11 Gyr being driven by a statistically similar star-forming population across cosmic time, but with a strong luminosity increase from z ˜ 0 to ˜2.2. Our uniform analysis allows us to derive the H$\alpha$ star formation history (SFRH) of the Universe, showing a clear rise up to z ˜ 2.2, for which the simple parametrization log10$\rho$SFR = -2.1(1 + z)-1 is valid over 80 per cent of the age of the Universe. The results reveal that both the shape and normalization of the H$\alpha$ SFRH are consistent with the measurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our H$\alpha$ SFRH is tracing the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe for z {\textless} 2.23. The star formation activity over the last ˜11 Gyr is responsible for producing ˜95 per cent of the total stellar mass density observed locally, with half of that being assembled in 2 Gyr between z = 1.2 and 2.2, and the other half in 8 Gyr (since z {\textless} 1.2). If the star formation rate density continues to decline with time in the same way as seen in the past ˜11 Gyr, then the stellar mass density of the Universe will reach a maximum which is only 5 per cent higher than the present-day value.},

All the galaxies were detected in both channels. UV light, both diffuse and from star clusters, can be traced to within the inner kpc of the dominant near-IR nuclei. However, in general, the brightest UV sources are clearly displaced from the {\$}I{\$}-band and near-IR peaks by at least hundreds of pc. Further, only 0.07{\%}-7.3{\%} of the total near-UV light is projected within the inner 500 pc radius, even though this is the same region wherein most of the bolometric energy is generated. All nuclei are highly obscured by dust. (Abridged)},

A galaxy class recently discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the UFDs appear to be an extension of the classical dwarf spheroidals to low luminosities, offering a new front in efforts to understand the missing satellite problem. They are the least luminous, most dark-matter dominated, and least chemically-evolved galaxies known. Our HST survey of six UFDs seeks to determine if these galaxies are true fossils from the early universe. We present here the preliminary analysis of three UFD galaxies: Hercules, Leo IV, and Ursa Major I. Classical dwarf spheroidals of the Local Group exhibit extended star formation histories, but these three Milky Way satellites are at least as old as the ancient globular cluster M92, with no evidence for intermediate-age populations. Their ages also appear to be synchronized to within {\~{}}1 Gyr of each other, as might be expected if their star formation was truncated by a global event, such as reionization.},

abstract = {We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit HST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four of the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3 {\$}H{\_}{\{}140{\}}{\$} imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel {\$}I{\_}{\{}814{\}}{\$} imaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric catalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has 98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 26{\$} and 22,548 with {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$}, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.

Based on comparisons with ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxies and repeat observations, the typical redshift error for {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$} galaxies in our catalog is {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z \backslashapprox 0.003 \backslashtimes (1+z){\$}, i.e., one native WFC3 pixel.

abstract = {We present an empirical method of assessing the star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies based on their locations in the rest-frame color-color diagram (NUV-r) vs (r-K). By using the Spitzer 24 micron sample in the COSMOS field ({\~{}}16400 galaxies with 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3) and a local GALEX-SDSS-SWIRE sample ({\~{}}700 galaxies with z {\textless} 0.2), we show that the mean infrared excess {\textless}IRX{\textgreater}= {\textless} L{\_}IR / L{\_}UV {\textgreater} can be described by a single vector, NRK, that combines the two colors. The calibration between {\textless}IRX{\textgreater} and NRK allows us to recover the IR luminosity, L{\_}IR, with an accuracy of {\~{}}0.21 dex for the COSMOS sample and {\~{}}0.27 dex for the local one. The SFRs derived with this method agree with the ones based on the observed (UV+IR) luminosities and on the spectral energy distribution fitting for the vast majority ({\~{}}85 {\%}) of the star-forming population. Thanks to a library of model galaxy SEDs with realistic prescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include a two-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ISM) and a full distribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the {\textless}IRX{\textgreater} stripes in the NUVrK diagram. In conclusion, the NRK method, based only on rest-frame UV and optical colors available in most of the extragalactic fields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the SFR of star-forming galaxies in the absence of far-IR or spectral diagnostic observations.},

abstract = {We show empirically that fits to the color-magnitude relation of Type Ia supernovae after optical maximum can provide accurate relative extragalactic distances. We report the discovery of an empirical color relation for Type Ia light curves: During much of the first month past maximum, the magnitudes of Type Ia supernovae defined at a given value of color index have a very small magnitude dispersion; moreover, during this period the relation between {\$}B{\$} magnitude and {\$}B-V{\$} color (or {\$}B-R{\$} or {\$}B-I{\$} color) is strikingly linear, to the accuracy of existing well-measured data. These linear relations can provide robust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the supernova reaches a given color. After correction for light curve strech factor or decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the linear color-magnitude relation are found to be around 0{\$}{\^{}}m{\$}.08 for the sub-sample of supernovae with $\backslash$BVm {\$}\backslashle 0{\^{}}m.05{\$}, and around 0{\$}{\^{}}m{\$}.11 for the sub-sample with $\backslash$BVm {\$}\backslashle 0{\^{}}m.2{\$}. This small dispersion is consistent with being mostly due to observational errors. The method presented here and the conventional light curve fitting methods can be combined to further improve statistical dispersions of distance estimates. It can be combined with the magnitude at maximum to deduce dust extinction. The slopes of the color-magnitude relation may also be used to identify intrinsically different SN Ia systems. The method provides a tool that is fundamental to using SN Ia to estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass and dark energy content of the universe.},

abstract = {The dimming of Type Ia supernovae could be the result of Hubble-scale inhomogeneity in the matter and spatial curvature, rather than signaling the presence of a dark energy component. A key challenge for such models is to fit the detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a detailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe, focusing on spherically symmetric `void' models. We allow for the dynamical effects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work which inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile. This is a surprisingly important effect and we reach substantially different conclusions. Models which are open at CMB distances fit the CMB power spectrum without fine tuning; these models also fit the supernovae and local Hubble rate data which favours a high expansion rate. Asymptotically flat models may fit the CMB, but require some extra assumptions. We argue that a full treatment of the radiation in these models is necessary if we are to understand the correct constraints from the CMB, as well as other observations which rely on it, such as spectral distortions of the black body spectrum, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.},

abstract = {We analyse 14 LBGs at z{\~{}}2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both a spectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep IR observations (CANDELS+HUGS survey) are available. Fixing the metallicity of population synthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physical parameters under different assumptions on the star-formation history and considering also the effect of nebular emission. For comparison we determine the UV slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their SFR{\_}UV99 by correcting the UV luminosity following Meurer et al. (1999). A comparison between SFR obtained through SED-fitting (SFR{\_}fit) and the SFR{\_}UV99 shows that the latter are underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed SFH. Other SFR indicators (radio, far-IR, X-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate SFRs a factor 2-4 larger than SFR{\_}UV99 and in closer agreement with SFR{\_}fit. Such discrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-A1600 conversion factor. We propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solar metallicity LBGs: A1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. This relation reconciles the dust-corrected UV with the SED-fitting and the other SFR indicators. We show that the fact that z{\~{}}3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upward revision by a factor of {\~{}}1.5-2 of the global SFRD, depending on the assumptions on the age of the stellar populations. We find very young best-fit ages (10-500 Myrs) for all our objects. From a careful examination of the uncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the Balmer break we conclude that there is little evidence for the presence of old stellar population in at least half of the LBGs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probably caught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of a smooth evolution.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations to z{\~{}}2 with purely photometric data, employing a novel rest-frame color selection technique. From the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey Data Release 1, with matched optical and mid-IR photometry taken from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey and Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey respectively, we construct a K-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts. Excluding stars, objects with uncertain z{\_}phot solutions, those that fall in bad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-frame colors could not be derived, 30108 galaxies with K{\textless}22.4 (AB) and z{\textless}2.5 remain. The galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies (analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extending from blue to red U-V colors. This bimodal behavior is seen up to z{\~{}}2. Due to a combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z{\textgreater}2 for this sample, but we show that MIPS 24um data suggest that a significant population of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z=1-2, the most luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos. This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.},

abstract = {We investigate the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR) of a sample of 30 quasars in the redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, by using near-IR and optical spectra. We focus on the ratio of the broad lines (SiIV1397+OIV]1402)/CIV1549, which is a good metallicity tracer of the BLR. We find that the metallicity of the BLR is very high even in QSOs at z{\~{}}6. The inferred metallicity of the BLR gas is so high (several times solar) that metal ejection or mixing with lower metallicity gas in the host galaxy is required to match the metallicities observed in local massive galaxies. On average, the observed metallicity changes neither among quasars in the observed redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, nor when compared with quasars at lower redshifts. We show that the apparent lack of metallicity evolution is a likely consequence of both the black hole-galaxy co-evolution and of selection effects. The data also suggest a lack of evolution in the carbon abundance, even among z{\textgreater}6 quasars. The latter result is puzzling, since the minimum enrichment timescale of carbon is about 1 Gyr, i.e. longer than the age of the universe at z{\~{}}6.},

Detailed observations reveal characteristics which allow to deduce the evolutionary paths and to witness how the environment has affected the evolution. Here we review peculiarities of general morphological DG types and refer to processes which can deplete gas-rich irregular DGs leading to dwarf ellipticals, while gas replenishment implies an evolutionary cycling. Finally, as the less understood DG types the Milky Way satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies are discussed in the context of transformation.},

If the attenuation formula is inapplicable to these galaxies, perhaps the disagreements are unphysical; perhaps dust distributions in these galaxies are uniform.

Particularly accurate relative distances are compiled and homogenized a) for 246 SNe Ia and 35 clusters with v{\textless}30,000 km/s, and b) for relatively nearby galaxies with 176 TRGB and 30 Cepheid distances. The 487 objects define a tight Hubble diagram from 300-30,000 km/s implying individual distance errors of {\textless}7.5{\%}. Here the velocities are corrected for Virgocentric steaming (locally 220 km/s) and - if v{\_}220{\textgreater}3500 km/s - for a 495 km/s motion of the Local Supercluster towards the warm CMB pole at l=275, b=12; local peculiar motions are averaged out by large numbers. A test for linear expansion shows that the corrected velocities increase with distance as predicted by a standard model with q{\_}0=-0.55 [corresponding to (Omega{\_}M, Omega{\_}Lambda)=(0.3,0.7)], but the same holds - due to the distance limitation of the present sample - for a range of models with q{\_}0 between {\~{}}0.00 and -1.00. For these models H{\_}0 does not vary systematically by more than +/-2.3{\%} over the entire range. Local, distance-dependent variations are equally limited to 2.3{\%} on average. In particular the proposed Hubble Bubble of Zehavi et al. and Jha et al. is rejected at the 4sigma level. - Velocity residuals in function of the angle from the CMB pole yield a satisfactory apex velocity of 448+/-73 km/s and a coherence radius of the Local Supercluster of {\~{}}3500 km/s ({\~{}}56 Mpc), beyond which galaxies are seen on average at rest in co-moving coordinates with respect to the CMB. Since no obvious single accelerator of the Local Supercluster exists in the direction of the CMB dipole its motion must be due to the integral gravitational force of all surrounding structures. Most of the gravitational dipole comes probably from within 5000 km/s.},

abstract = {We present Keck/MOSFIRE spectra of the diagnostic nebular emission lines [OIII]5007,4959, [OII]3727, and H-beta for a sample of 15 redshift z=3.1-3.7 Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). In conjunction with spectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a much higher [OIII]/[OII] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By comparing their distributions on a [OIII]/[OII] versus R23 diagram, we demonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower metallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using measures of H-beta and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of our LAEs, that xi{\_}ion - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity - is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts. Using photoionization models we estimate the effect this would have on both [OIII]/[OII] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially explain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a large [OIII]/[OII] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound nebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. We discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly LAEs with intense [OIII] emission represent a promising analog of those z{\textgreater}7 sources with similarly strong lines which are thought to be an important contributor to cosmic reionization.},

abstract = {We derive average radial gradients in the dust attenuation towards HII regions in 609 galaxies at z{\~{}}1.4, using measurements of the Balmer decrement out to r{\~{}}3kpc. The Balmer decrements are derived from spatially resolved maps of Halpha and Hbeta emission from the 3D-HST survey. We find that with increasing stellar mass (M) both the normalization and strength of the gradient in dust attenuation increases. Galaxies with a mean mass of {\textless}log(M){\textgreater} = 9.2Msun have little dust attenuation at all radii, whereas galaxies with {\textless}log(M){\textgreater}= 10.2Msun have dust attenuation toward Halpha A(Halpha){\~{}}2mag in their central regions. We parameterize this as A(Halpha) = b + c log(r), with b = 0.9 + 1.0 log(M10), c = -1.9 - 2.2 log(M10), r in kpc, and M10 the stellar mass in units of 10{\^{}}10Msun. This expression can be used to correct spatially resolved measurements of Halpha to radial distributions of star formation. When applied to our data, we find that the star formation rates in the central r{\textless}1kpc of galaxies in the highest mass bin are {\~{}} 6 Msun/yr, six times higher than before correction and approximately half of the total star formation rate of these galaxies. If this high central star formation rate is maintained for several Gyr, a large fraction of the stars in present-day bulges likely formed in-situ.},

abstract = {We measure the stellar mass-star formation rate relation in star-forming disk galaxies at z{\textless}0.085, using Galaxy{\~{}}Zoo morphologies to examine different populations of spirals as classified by their kiloparsec-scale structure. We examine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presence of a galactic bar in the disk, and show that both the slope and dispersion of the M-SFR relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. We also show that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongest conditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost the SFR above the main relation by {\~{}}0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than the increase seen in merging systems at z{\textgreater}1. Of the galaxies lying significantly above the M-SFR relation in the local Universe, more than 50{\%} are mergers. We interpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfect reflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fully independent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmed by the combination of outflows and feedback. The arrangement of the star formation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even in the presence of strong dynamical forcing.},

abstract = {We present an updated analysis of the intrinsic colors of SNe Ia using the latest data release of the Carnegie Supernova Project. We introduce a new light-curve parameter very similar to stretch that is better suited for fast-declining events, and find that these peculiar types can be seen as extensions to the population of "normal" SNe Ia. With a larger number of objects, an updated fit to the Lira relation is presented along with evidence for a dependence on the late-time slope of the B-V color-curves with stretch and color. Using the full wavelength range from u to H band, we place constraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also for individual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. The photometric data continue to favor low values of Rv, though with large variations from event to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. We confirm the findings of other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derived reddening law, Rv, and the color excess, E(B-V), such that larger E(B-V) tends to favor lower Rv. The intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatter that cannot be explained by variations in Rv or by the Goobar (2008) power-law for circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features of the supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.},

abstract = {It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example. In the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO2, and H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of CH4, and NH3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in the emerging spectra, and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. The 1-4um region will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 10{\^{}}5-10{\^{}}6 Myrs, based on the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.},

abstract = {We present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia Supernovae (0.03{\textless}z{\textless}0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 years of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We have investigated spatial and time variations in the photometry, and we find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2{\%} without accounting for the uncertainty in the HST Calspec definition of the AB system. We discuss our efforts to minimize the systematic uncertainties in the photometry. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 112 SNe Ia (out of the 146) that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 313 SNe Ia (112 PS1 SNe Ia + 201 low-z SNe Ia), using only SNe and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w = -1.015{\^{}}{\{}+0.319{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.201{\}}(Stat)+{\{}0.164{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.122{\}}(Sys).

If we include WMAP9 CMB constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w = -1.142{\^{}}{\{}+0.076{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.087{\}}, which diminishes the discord to {\textless}2 sigma. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors.

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A to 160 micron, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally-pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios [abridged].},

abstract = {Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosities with a scatter of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.16 dex and an offset of 0.08 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z{\~{}}2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of {\~{}}1 kpc. We have obtained a {\~{}}29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z{\textgreater}2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 Msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of {\~{}}2x10{\^{}}11 Msol. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is {\textless}1{\%} of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes {\textless}8{\%} to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up {\textless}10{\%} of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to {\~{}}40{\%} of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

abstract = {Measurements of the UV-continuum slopes provide valuable information on the physical properties of galaxies forming in the early universe, probing the dust reddening, age, metal content, and even the escape fraction. While constraints on these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the UV continuum shifts out of the Hubble Space Telescope bands (particularly at z{\textgreater}7), such a characterisation actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in the redshift window z=9.5-10.5 due to the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6um-band probing the rest-UV continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this Spitzer band and the Hubble H-band. Higher S/N constraints on the UV slope are possible at z{\~{}}10 than at z=8. Here we take advantage of this opportunity and five recently discovered bright z=9.5-10.5 galaxies to present the first measurements of the mean slope for a multi-object sample of galaxy candidates at z{\~{}}10. We find the measured observed slopes of these candidates are {\$}-2.1\backslashpm0.3\backslashpm0.2{\$} (random and systematic), only slightly bluer than the measured slopes at 3.5{\textless}z{\textless}7.5 for galaxies of similar luminosities. Small increases in the stellar ages, metallicities, and dust content of the galaxy population from z{\~{}}10 to z{\~{}}7 could easily explain the apparent evolution in slopes.},

abstract = {We present a systematic study for ionization state of inter-stellar medium in galaxies at z = 0- with ˜140 000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies and 108 intermediate- to high-redshift galaxies from the literature, using an ionization parameter sensitive line ratio of [O III]lambda5007/[O II]lambda3727 and photoionization models. We confirm that z ˜ 2-3 galaxies show an [O III]/[O II] ratio significantly higher than a typical star-forming galaxy of SDSS by a factor of ≳ 10, and the photoionization models reveal that these high-z galaxies have an ionization parameter of log (qion/cm s-1) ˜ 7.6-9.0, a factor of ˜4-10 higher than local galaxies. For galaxies at any redshift, we identify a correlation between the [O III]/[O II] ratio and galaxy global properties of star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M*), and metallicity (Z). We extend the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) and develop the fundamental ionization relation (FIR), a four-dimensional relation of ionization parameter, SFR, M*, and Z. The intermediate- and high-z galaxies up to z {\~{}}= 3 follow the FIR defined with the local galaxies, in contrast with the FMR whose possible evolution from z ˜ 2 to 3 is reported. We find that the FMR evolution of z ˜ 2-3 appears, if one omits ionization parameter differences, and that the FMR evolution does not exist for an average metallicity solution of z ˜ 3 galaxies with a high-ionization parameter. Interestingly, all of two local Lyman-continuum emitting galaxies (LyC leakers) have a high [O III]/[O II] ratio, indicating a positive correlation between [O III]/[O II] and ionizing photon escape fraction (fesc), which is successfully explained by our photoionization models. Because [O III]/[O II] ratios of z ˜ 2-3 galaxies, especially Lyalpha emitters (LAEs), are comparable to, or higher than, those of the local LyC leakers, these high-z galaxies are candidates of Lyman-continuum emitting objects. A strong Lyalpha emission can coexist with a large fesc of ≲ 0.8, and the increasing fraction of LAEs towards high-z reconciles the picture of cosmic reionization whose major ionizing sources are faint galaxies having intrinsically bright Lyalpha emission.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the need for dark energy, were inferred from observations of type Ia supernovae. There is a consensus that type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions that destroy carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that have accreted matter from a companion star, although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. These supernovae are thought to be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears the Chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 solar masses (M(o)). Here we show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae should occur preferentially in a young stellar population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that overluminous type Ia supernovae occur only in 'young' environments. As this supernova does not obey the relations that allow type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as standard candles, and as no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology studies will have to consider possible contamination from such events.},

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the H$\alpha$ equivalent width, EW(H$\alpha$), with redshift and its dependence on stellar mass, using the first data from the 3D-HST survey, a large spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. Combining our H$\alpha$ measurements of 854 galaxies at 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 with those of ground-based surveys at lower and higher redshift, we can consistently determine the evolution of the EW(H$\alpha$) distribution from z = 0 to z = 2.2. We find that at all masses the characteristic EW(H$\alpha$) is decreasing toward the present epoch, and that at each redshift the EW(H$\alpha$) is lower for high-mass galaxies. We find EW(H$\alpha$) {\~{}}(1 + z)1.8 with little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a model-independent confirmation of the evolution of star-forming galaxies with redshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(H$\alpha$) to specific star formation rate (sSFR) is model dependent because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(H$\alpha$) can be reproduced with the characteristic evolutionary history for galaxies, whose star formation rises with cosmic time to z {\~{}} 2.5 and then decreases to z = 0. This implies that EW(H$\alpha$) rises to 400 {\AA} at z = 8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(H$\alpha$), as the mass-to-light ratio also evolves with redshift. We find that the sSFR evolves as (1 + z)3.2, nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous reddening insensitive estimates. We confirm previous results that the observed slope of the sSFR-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, but models and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

These objects, SN CLO12Car (z = 1.28), SN CLN12Did (z = 0.85), and SN CLA11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and Abell 383 (z = 0.187), respectively. Each SN was detected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared images. Based on photometric classification, we find that SNe CLO12Car and CLN12Did are likely to be Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), while SN CLA11Tib is probably a core-collapse SN. Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we infer that SN CLO12Car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted magnification from CLASH strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/- 0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11 mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. Our results herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia (from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution in clusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolute magnifications.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {Using star-forming galaxies sample in the nearby Universe (0.02{\textless}z{\textless}0.10) selected from the SDSS (DR7) and GALEX all-sky survey (GR5), we present a new empirical calibration for predicting dust extinction of galaxies from H-alpha-to-FUV flux ratio. We find that the H-alpha dust extinction (A(Ha)) derived with H-alpha/H-beta ratio (Balmer decrement) increases with increasing H-alpha/UV ratio as expected, but there remains a considerable scatter around the relation, which is largely dependent on stellar mass and/or H-alpha equivalent width (EW(Ha)). At fixed H-alpha/UV ratio, galaxies with higher stellar mass (or galaxies with lower EW(Ha)) tend to be more highly obscured by dust. We quantify this trend and establish an empirical calibration for predicting A(Ha) with a combination of H-alpha/UV ratio, stellar mass and EW(Ha), with which we can successfully reduce the systematic uncertainties accompanying the simple H-alpha/UV approach by {\~{}}15-30{\%}. The new recipes proposed in this study will provide a convenient tool for predicting dust extinction level of galaxies particularly when Balmer decrement is not available. By comparing A(Ha) (derived with Balmer decrement) and A(UV) (derived with IR/UV luminosity ratio) for a subsample of galaxies for which AKARI FIR photometry is available, we demonstrate that more massive galaxies tend to have higher extra extinction towards the nebular regions compared to the stellar continuum light. Considering recent studies reporting smaller extra extinction towards nebular regions for high-redshift galaxies, we argue that the dust geometry within high-redshift galaxies resemble more like low-mass galaxies in the nearby Universe.},

abstract = {The dominant baryonic component of galaxy clusters is hot gas whose distribution is commonly probed through X-ray emission arising from thermal bremsstrahlung. The density profile thus obtained has been traditionally modeled with a beta-profile, a simple function with only three parameters. However, this model is known to be insufficient for characterizing the range of cluster gas distributions, and attempts to rectify this shortcoming typically introduce additional parameters to increase the fitting flexibility. We use cosmological and physical considerations to obtain a family of profiles for the gas with fewer parameters than the beta-model but which better accounts for observed gas profiles over wide radial intervals.},

We also see evidence for number density downsizing, such that the galaxies selected at the lowest densities (highest masses) become a homogeneous red population before those at higher number densities. Examining the evolution of the colours for these systems furthermore shows that the formation redshift of galaxies selected at these number densities is {\$}z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm form{\}}{\textgreater}3{\$}. The structural evolution through size and Sersic index fits reveal that while there remains evolution in terms of galaxies becoming larger and more concentrated in stellar mass at lower redshifts, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than for a mass selected sample. We also find that changes in size and structure continues at {\$}z {\textless} 1{\$}, and is coupled strongly to passivity evolution. We conclude that galaxy structure is driving the quenching of galaxies, such that galaxies become concentrated before they become passive.},

abstract = {We investigate in this paper the astrophysical false-positive configuration in exoplanet-transit surveys that involves eclipsing binaries and giant planets which present only a secondary eclipse, as seen from the Earth. To test how an eclipsing binary configuration can mimic a planetary transit, we generate synthetic light curve of three examples of secondary-only eclipsing binary systems that we fit with a circular planetary model. Then, to evaluate its occurrence we model a population of binaries in double and triple system based on binary statistics and occurrence. We find that 0.061{\%} +/- 0.017{\%} of main-sequence binary stars are secondary-only eclipsing binaries mimicking a planetary transit candidate down to the size of the Earth. We then evaluate the occurrence that an occulting-only giant planet can mimic an Earth-like planet or even smaller planet. We find that 0.009{\%} +/- 0.002{\%} of stars harbor a giant planet that present only the secondary transit. Occulting-only giant planets mimic planets smaller than the Earth that are in the scope of space missions like Kepler and PLATO. We estimate that up to 43.1 +/- 5.6 Kepler Objects of Interest can be mimicked by this new configuration of false positives, re-evaluating the global false-positive rate of the Kepler mission from 9.4{\%} +/- 0.9{\%} to 11.3{\%} +/- 1.1{\%}. We note however that this new false-positive scenario occurs at relatively long orbital period compared with the median period of Kepler candidates.},

Because of the nature of the two surveys (distance-limited with small baselines and deep limiting magnitudes), nearly all SNe Ia have been discovered in the sample galaxies of LOSS and BAOSS; thus, the observed peculiarity rate and luminosity function of SNe Ia are intrinsic. We find that 36{\$}\backslashpm{\$}9{\%} of nearby SNe Ia are peculiar; specifically, the luminosity function of SNe Ia consists of 20{\%} SN 1991T-like, 64{\%} normal, and 16{\%} SN 1991bg-like objects. We have compared our results to those found by earlier studies, and to those found at high redshift. The apparent dearth of SN 1991T-like objects at high redshift may be due to extinction, and especially to the difficulty of recognizing them from spectra obtained past maximum brightness or from spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios. Implications of the high peculiarity rate for the progenitor systems of SNe Ia are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Most stars and their planets form in open clusters. Over 95 per cent of such clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart within a few hundred million years. Older open clusters have survived by virtue of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field. The field planets are usually the size of Neptune or smaller. In contrast, only four planets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the most profound discoveries in modern cosmology, pointing to a universe in which 70{\%} of the mass-energy density has an unknown form spread uniformly across the universe. This result has been well established using a combination of cosmological probes (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), resulting in a "standard model" of modern cosmology that is a combination of a cosmological constant with cold dark matter and baryons. The first compelling evidence for this acceleration came in the late 1990's, when two independent teams studying type Ia supernovae discovered that distant SNe Ia were dimmer than expected. The combined analysis of modern cosmology experiments, including SNe Ia (Betoule et al. 2014), the cosmic microwave background (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), and baryon acoustic oscillations (Alam et al. 2016), indicate {\~{}} 75 sigma evidence for positive Omega{\_}Lambda. A recent study has claimed that the evidence for acceleration from SNe Ia is marginal. Here we demonstrate errors in that analysis which reduce the significance from SNe Ia, and show that constraints on the flatness or matter density of the universe greatly increase the significance of acceleration. Analyzing the Joint Light-curve Analysis supernova sample, we find 4.2 sigma evidence for acceleration with SNe Ia alone, and 11.2 sigma in a flat universe. With the correct supernova analysis and by not rejecting all other cosmological constraints, we find that acceleration is quite secure.},

abstract = {We combine new Spitzer Space Telescope observations in the mid- and far-infrared with SCUBA 850 micron observations to improve the measurement of dust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey (SLUGS). By fitting dust models we measure typical dust masses of 10E7.9 M{\_}sol and dust luminosities of {\~{}} 10E10 L{\_}sol, for galaxies with modest star formation rates. The data presented in this paper combined with previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types of spiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. Because of the lower dust temperature of the SCUBA sources measured in this paper, they have flatter Far-IR nu F{\_}nu(160um)/nu F{\_}nu(850um) slopes than the larger Spitzer Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), the sample that provides the best measurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. The new data presented here added to SINGS extend the parameter space that is well covered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that can be used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.},

abstract = {We use very deep near-infrared photometry of the Hubble Deep Field-South taken with ISAAC on the Very Large Telescope to identify a population of high-redshift galaxies with rest-frame optical colors similar to those of nearby galaxies. The galaxies are chosen by their infrared colors Js-Ks{\textgreater}2.3, aimed at selecting galaxies with redshifts above 2. When applied to our data set, we find 14 galaxies with Ks{\textless}22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3+/-0.8 arcmin-2. The photometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and an rms of 0.7. The spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range. One is very blue in the rest-frame UV and satisfies the normal Lyman break criteria for high-redshift, star-forming galaxies. Others are quite red throughout the observed spectral range and are extremely faint in the optical, with a median V=26.6. Hence, these galaxies would not be included in photometric samples based on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult. The spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified as the Balmer break or the 4000 {\AA} break. The median age is 1 Gyr when fitted with a constant star formation model with dust or 0.7 Gyr when fitted with a single burst model. Although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when a larger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies are among the oldest at these redshifts. The volume density to Ks=22.5 is half that of Lyman break galaxies at z{\~{}}3. Since the mass-to-light ratios of the red galaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to be comparable to that of Lyman break galaxies. These red galaxies may be the descendants of galaxies that started to form stars at very high redshifts, and they may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.

abstract = {Much of the science that is made possible by multiwavelength redshift surveys requires the use of photometric redshifts. But as these surveys become more ambitious, and as we seek to perform increasingly accurate measurements, it becomes crucial to take proper account of the photometric redshift uncertainties. Ideally the uncertainties can be directly measured using a comparison with spectroscopic redshifts, but this may yield misleading results since spectroscopic samples are frequently small and not representative of the parent photometric samples. We present a simple and powerful empirical method to constrain photometric redshift uncertainties in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts. Close pairs of galaxies on the sky have a significant probability of being physically associated and therefore of lying at nearly the same redshift. The difference in photometric redshifts in close pairs is therefore a measure of the redshift uncertainty. Some observed close pairs will arise from chance projections along the line of sight, but it is straightforward to perform a statistical correction for this effect. We demonstrate the technique using both simulated data and actual observations, and discuss how its usefulness can be limited by the presence of systematic photometric redshift errors. Finally, we use this technique to show how photometric redshift accuracy can depend on galaxy type.},

@article{Smit2014,
abstract = {Growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has a significant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z{\~{}}5-7 galaxies observed with Spitzer. This line emission makes z{\~{}}5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with lower specific star formation rates. However, corrections for this line emission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertainties on the overall strength of such emission at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5.5. Here, we present the most direct observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-EW [OIII]+Hbeta line emission in Lyman-break galaxies at z{\~{}}7, while also presenting a strategy for an improved measurement of the sSFR at z{\~{}}7. We accomplish this through the selection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z{\~{}}6.6-7.0 where the IRAC 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum light. Observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micron fluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [OIII]+Hbeta lines. To ensure a high S/N for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest (H{\_}{\{}160{\}}{\textless}26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in CLASH and other programs targeting galaxy clusters. Remarkably, the mean rest-frame optical color for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3. Such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require that the rest-frame EW of [OIII]+Hbeta be greater than 637 Angstroms for the average source. The bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require an even more extreme EW of 1582 Angstroms. Our derived lower limit for the mean [OIII]+Hbeta EW could underestimate the true EW by {\~{}}2x based on a simple modeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. We can also set a robust lower limit of {\textgreater}{\~{}}4 Gyr{\^{}}-1 on the specific star formation rates based on the mean SED for our seven-source sample. (abridged)},

We use a custom-built Lya narrow-band filter at the Isaac Newton Telescope, designed to provide a matched volume coverage to the z=2.23 Ha HiZELS survey.

Our survey currently reaches a 3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} line flux limit of {\~{}}4x10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$} erg/s/cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}, and a Lya luminosity limit of {\~{}}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}42.3{\}}{\$} erg/s.

These sources are important contaminants, and we carefully remove them, unlike most previous studies.

Lya emitters have ubiquitous large ({\~{}}40 kpc) Lya haloes, 2x larger than their Ha extents. By directly comparing our Lya and Ha luminosity functions we find that the global/overall escape fraction of Lya photons (within a 13 kpc radius) from the full population of star-forming galaxies is 5.1+-0.2{\%} at the peak of the star formation history. An extra 3.3+-0.3{\%} of Lya photons likely still escape, but at larger radii.},

To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck and developed by Draine and Lee (1984) from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

abstract = {We present the relation between galaxy structure and spectral type, using a K-selected galaxy sample at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0. Based on similarities between the UV-to-NIR spectral energy distributions, we classify galaxies into 32 spectral types. The different types span a wide range in evolutionary phases, and thus -- in combination with available CANDELS/F160W imaging -- are ideal to study the structural evolution of galaxies. Effective radii (R{\_}e) and Sersic parameters (n) have been measured for 572 individual galaxies, and for each type, we determine R{\_}e at fixed stellar mass by correcting for the mass-size relation. We use the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J diagram to investigate evolutionary trends. When moving into the direction perpendicular to the star-forming sequence, in which we see the Halpha equivalent width and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) decrease, we find a decrease in R{\_}e and an increase in n. On the quiescent sequence we find an opposite trend, with older redder galaxies being larger. When splitting the sample into redshift bins, we find that young post-starburst galaxies are most prevalent at z{\textgreater}1.5 and significantly smaller than all other galaxy types at the same redshift. This result suggests that the suppression of star formation may be associated with significant structural evolution at z{\textgreater}1.5. At z{\textless}1, galaxy types with intermediate sSFRs (10{\^{}}{\{}-11.5{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-10.5{\}} yr{\^{}}-1) do not have post-starburst SED shapes. These galaxies have similar sizes as older quiescent galaxies, implying that they can passively evolve onto the quiescent sequence, without increasing the average size of the quiescent galaxy population.},

abstract = {We present measurements of $\backslash$Omega{\_}m and $\backslash$Omega{\_}{\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} from a blind analysis of 21 high-redshift supernovae using a new technique (CMAGIC) for fitting the multi-color lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae, first introduced in Wang et al. (2003). CMAGIC takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior of Type Ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages over current techniques based on maximum magnitudes. Among these are a reduced sensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-width relation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. This allows us to provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite the fact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for CMAGIC. We describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The data are broadly consistent with the picture of an accelerating Universe, and agree with a flat Universe within 1.7$\backslash$sigma, including systematics. We also compare the CMAGIC results directly with those of a maximum magnitude fit to the same SNe, finding that CMAGIC favors more acceleration at the 1.6$\backslash$sigma level, including systematics and the correlation between the two measurements. A fit for w assuming a flat Universe yields a value which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2$\backslash$sigma.},

abstract = {Recent surveys have identified a seemingly ubiquitous population of galaxies with elevated [OIII]/H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emission line ratios at {\$}z {\textgreater} 1{\$}, though the nature of this phenomenon continues to be debated. The [OIII]/H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} line ratio is of interest because it is a main component of the standard diagnostic tools used to differentiate between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, as well as the gas-phase metallicity indicators {\$}O{\_}{\{}23{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}{\{}23{\}}{\$}. Here, we investigate the primary driver of increased [OIII]/H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} ratios by median-stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range {\$}z\backslashsim1.4-2.2{\$}. Using {\$}N = 4220{\$} star-forming galaxies, we stack the data in bins of mass and specific star formation rates (sSFR) respectively. After accounting for stellar Balmer absorption, we measure [OIII]{\$}\backslashlambda5007{\$}$\backslash$AA/H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} down to {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}9.2{\}} \backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and sSFR {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-9.6{\}} \backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, more than an order of magnitude lower than previous work at similar redshifts. We find an offset of {\$}0.59\backslashpm0.05{\$} dex between the median ratios at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} at fixed stellar mass, in agreement with existing studies. However, with respect to sSFR, the {\$}z \backslashsim 2{\$} stacks all lie within 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} of the median SDSS ratios, with an average offset of only {\$}-0.06\backslashpm 0.05{\$}. We find that the excitation properties of galaxies are tightly correlated with their sSFR at both {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}, with a relation that appears to be roughly constant over the last 10 Gyr of cosmic time.},

abstract = {Dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dust properties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energy distributions. In particular the presence or absence of a UV bump at 2175 A remains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broad band colours of distant galaxies. We study the dust attenuation curve in the UV range at z {\textgreater}1. In particular we search for the presence of a UV bump. We use deep photometric data of the CDFS obtained with intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project to sample the UV rest-frame of galaxies with 1{\textless}z {\textless}2. Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS data are used to measure the dust emission. 30 galaxies were selected with high S/N in all bands. Their SEDs from the UV to the far-IR are fitted using the CIGALE code and the characteristics of the dust attenuation curve are obtained. The mean dust attenuation curve we derive exhibits a UV bump at 2175A whose amplitude corresponds to 35 {\%} (76{\%}) that of the MW (LMC2 supershell) extinction curve. An analytical expression of the average attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than the Calzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. Our galaxy sample is used to study the derivation of the slopes of the UV continuum from broad band colours, including the GALEX FUV-NUV colour. Systematic errors induced by the presence of the bump are quantified. We compare dust attenuation factors measured with CIGALE to the slope of the UV continuum and find that there is a large scatter around the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). The uncertainties on the determination of the UV slope lead to an extra systematic error of the order of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the UV bump.},

From the H{\_}alpha line identified in the host spectra, we determine a redshift of 0.0736. At this distance, the supernova reached an absolute magnitude of -20.4, brighter than any other SNe Ia ever observed. If the source of luminosity is radioactive decay, a large amount of radioactive nickel ({\~{}}1.5 solar masses) is required to power the peak luminosity, more than can be produced realistically in a Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. Low expansion velocity, similar to that of 2003fg, is also measured around the maximum light. The observations may suggest that SN 2007if was from a massive white dwarf progenitor, plausibly exploding with mass well beyond 1.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we investigate circumstellar interaction that may contribute to the excess luminosity.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations.

abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual {\&} Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05) and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence is incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K and V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr colors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

Supported by spectroscopic confirmation of strong [OIII] emission lines -- with rest-frame equivalent widths {\~{}}1000$\backslash$AA -- in the four candidates that have HST/WFC3 grism observations, we conclude that these objects are galaxies with 10{\^{}}8 Msol in stellar mass, undergoing an enormous starburst phase with M{\_}*/(dM{\_}*/dt) of only {\~{}}15 Myr. These bursts may cause outflows that are strong enough to produce cored dark matter profiles in low-mass galaxies.

abstract = {The Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and in our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate star-forming galaxies, that may include or exclude galaxies with specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of star-forming galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such definition are manifold. If generally adopted it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass diagnostics, or to highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All this could help understanding MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.},

abstract = {We characterize the radial and angular variance of the Hubble flow in the COMPOSITE sample of 4534 galaxies, on scales in which much of the flow is in the nonlinear regime. Independent of any cosmological assumptions other than the existence of a suitably averaged linear Hubble law, we find with decisive Bayesian evidence (ln B {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 5) that the Hubble constant averaged in spherical radial shells is closer to its asymptotic value when referred to the rest frame of the Local Group rather than the standard rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Angular averages reveal a dipole structure in the Hubble flow, whose amplitude in the two rest frames changes in correlation with the monopole variation within spheres of radius 30/h - 62/h Mpc in markedly different ways, with 99.99{\%} confidence. The angular map of Hubble flow variation is found to coincide with that of the residual CMB temperature dipole in the Local Group rest frame, with correlation coefficient -0.92. The combined results of the monopole and dipole variations do not support the standard kinematic interpretation of the motion of the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole, but are consistent with a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in the distance-redshift relation of 0.5{\%} on scales up to 65/h Mpc. Effectively, the differential expansion of space produced by nearby nonlinear structures of local voids and denser walls and filaments cannot be reduced to a local boost. This hypothesis suggests a reinterpretation of bulk flows, which may potentially impact on calibration of supernovae distances, anomalies associated with large angles in the CMB anisotropy spectrum, and the dark flow inferred from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. It is consistent with recent studies that find evidence for a non-kinematic dipole in the distribution of distant radio sources.},

Deep rest-frame ultraviolet spectra reveal large equivalent width emission from numerous emission lines (N IV], O III], C IV, Si III], C III]) which are rarely seen in individual spectra of more massive star-forming galaxies. C III] is detected in 16 of 17 low-mass star-forming systems with rest-frame equivalent widths as large as 13.5 {\AA}. Nebular C IV emission is present in the most extreme C III] emitters, requiring an ionizing source capable of producing a substantial component of photons with energies in excess of 47.9 eV. Photoionization models support a picture whereby the large equivalent widths are driven by the increased electron temperature and enhanced ionizing output arising from metal-poor gas and stars (0.04-0.13 Z{\&}sun;), young stellar populations (6-50 Myr), and large ionization parameters (log U = -2.16 to -1.84). The young ages implied by the emission lines and continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicate that the extreme line emitters in our sample are in the midst of a significant upturn in their star formation activity. The low stellar masses, blue UV colours, and large specific star formation rates of our sample are similar to those of typical z ≳ 6 galaxies. Given the strong attenuation of Lyalpha in z ≳ 6 galaxies, we suggest that C III] is likely to provide our best probe of early star-forming galaxies with ground-based spectrographs and one off the most efficient means of confirming z ≳ 10 galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

In addition to this signal generated by Doppler boosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMB temperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation at cosmological distances). This is an order 0.1{\%} effect applied to fluctuations which are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quite small. Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, high angular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite. Here we report a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration and modulation effects on the CMB temperature anisotropies, finding a component in the known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.) +- 115km/s (syst.).

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

abstract = {Quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectral templates are important both to QSO physics and for investigations that use QSOs as probes of intervening gas and dust. However, combinations of various QSO samples obtained at different times and with different instruments so as to expand a composite and to cover a wider rest frame wavelength region may create systematic effects, and the contribution from QSO hosts may contaminate the composite. We have constructed a composite spectrum from luminous blue QSOs at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.1 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The observations with X-shooter simultaneously cover ultraviolet (UV) to near- infrared (NIR) light, which ensures that the composite spectrum covers the full rest-frame range from Ly{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} to 11350 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} without any significant host contamination. Assuming a power-law continuum for the composite we find a spectral slope of {\$}\backslashalpha{\_}\backslashlambda{\$} = 1.70+/-0.01, which is steeper than previously found in the literature. We attribute the differences to our broader spectral wavelength coverage, which allows us to effectively avoid fitting any regions that are affected either by strong QSO emissions lines (e.g., Balmer lines and complex [Fe II] blends) or by intrinsic host galaxy emission. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the QSO composite spectrum for evaluating the reddening in other QSOs.},

abstract = {The usefulness of type Ia supernovae as distance indicators is a matter of current study and discussion. The available data suggest that the intrinsic dispersion in the absolute B magnitudes of SNe Ia at maximum light is less than 0.4 mag. Hence, SNe Ia offer considerable potential for cosmological studies out to redshifts of z = 0.1 or greater. In this paper we make use of the best spectra available for type Ia supernovae in order to calculate the effect of the redshift on the observed B and V magnitudes. We present K terms in the redshift range z = 0.005-0.50 from a collection of spectra of SNe 1990N, 1991T, and 1992A covering from day -14 to day +76, counted from the time of maximum light in the blue band. Our calculations enable us to interpolate K terms for SNe Ia at maximum light, which should prove useful to study the Hubble diagram for these objects.},

abstract = {Since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope nine years ago, Cepheid distances to 25 galaxies have been determined for the purpose of calibrating secondary distance indicators. A variety of these can now be calibrated, and the accompanying papers by Sakai, Kelson, Ferrarese, and Gibson employ the full set of 25 galaxies to consider the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, Type Ia supernovae, and surface brightness fluctuations. When calibrated with Cepheid distances, each of these methods yields a measurement of the Hubble constant and a corresponding measurement uncertainty. We combine these measurements in this paper, together with a model of the velocity field, to yield the best available estimate of the value of H{\_}0 within the range of these secondary distance indicators and its uncertainty. The result is H{\_}0 = 71 +/- 6 km/sec/Mpc. The largest contributor to the uncertainty of this 67{\%} confidence level result is the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has been assumed to be 50 +/- 3 kpc.},

abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven year sky survey which began in May 2005, using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

Both sets of galaxies extend over the same range in stellar mass (7.5 {\textless} logM {\textless} 10.5), size (0.5 {\textless} R {\textless} 3.0 kpc), and star-formation rate ({\~{}}1 {\textless} SFR {\textless} 100). Remarkably, a comparison of the most commonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-light radius, UV slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance, star formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [O III] luminosity, and [O III] equivalent width -- reveals no statistically significant differences between the populations. This suggests that the processes and conditions which regulate the escape of Ly-alpha from a z {\~{}} 2 star-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. In particular, the lack of dependence on the UV slope suggests that Ly-alpha emission is not being significantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. We develop a simple model of Ly-alpha emission that connects LAEs to all high-redshift star forming galaxies where the escape of Ly-alpha depends on the sightline through the galaxy. Using this model, we find that mean solid angle for Ly-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with those calculated from other studies.},

abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\~{}}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\~{}}10{\^{}}8.5 - 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) with high star formation rates ({\~{}}10 M{\_}sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\~{}} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {\textless} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

abstract = {We combine Herschel PACS and SPIRE maps of the full 2 deg{\^{}}2 COSMOS field with existing multi-wavelength data to obtain template and model-independent optical-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 4,218 Herschel-selected sources with log(L{\_}IR/L{\_}sun) = 9.4-13.6 and z = 0.02-3.54. Median SEDs are created by binning the optical to far-infrared (FIR) bands available in COSMOS as a function of infrared luminosity. Herschel probes rest-frame wavelengths where the bulk of the infrared radiation is emitted, allowing us to more accurately determine fundamental dust properties of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies. We find that the SED peak wavelength (lambda{\_}peak) decreases and the dust mass (M{\_}dust) increases with increasing total infrared luminosity (L{\_}IR). In the lowest infrared luminosity galaxies (log(L{\_}IR/L{\_}sun) = 10.0-11.5), we see evidence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) features (lambda=7-9 um), while in the highest infrared luminosity galaxies (L{\_}IR {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}12 L{\_}sun) we see an increasing contribution of hot dust and/or power-law emission, consistent with the presence of heating from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We study the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies and find no evidence that Herschel-selected galaxies follow the SFR/M{\_}* "main sequence" as previously determined from studies of optically selected, star-forming galaxies. Finally, we compare the mid-infrared (MIR) to FIR properties of our infrared luminous galaxies using the previously defined diagnostic, IR8 = L{\_}IR / L{\_}8, and find that galaxies with L{\_}IR {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11.3 L{\_}sun tend to systematically lie above ({\~{}}3-5) the IR8 "infrared main sequence", suggesting either suppressed PAH emission or an increasing contribution from AGN heating.},

We produce an extensive database of dusty model galaxies, calculated starting from the new library of single stellar population (SSPs) models presented in Cassara' et al. 2013 and weighted by a set of 28 different SFHs based on the Schmidt function, and characterized by different ratios of the gas infall time scale {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}infall{\}}{\$} to the star formation efficiency {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. The treatment of dust extinction and re-emission has been carried out by means of the radiative transfer calculation. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique is performed by using GOSSIP+, a tool able to combine both photometric and spectroscopic information to extract the best value of the physical quantities of interest, and to consider the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) attenuation as a free parameter. We find that the main contribution to the scatter observed in the {\$}SFR-M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} plane is the possibility of choosing between different families of SFHs in the SED fitting procedure, while the redshift range plays a minor role. The majority of the galaxies, at all cosmic times, are best-fit by models with SFHs characterized by a high {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm infall{\}}/\backslashnu{\$} ratio.

abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend to long wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal star-forming galaxies. As was found by Dale et al. (2001), a single parameter family, characterized by f{\_}nu(60 microns)/f{\_}nu(100 microns), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy spectral energy distributions observed by IRAS and ISO from 3 to 100 microns. However, predictions based on the first generation models at longer wavelengths (122 to 850 microns) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller f{\_}nu(60 microns)/f{\_}nu(100 microns), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 microns to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well-described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but they have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than about 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive than their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical peak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One implication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be an artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy formation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the high-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could number in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8 km/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses. Alternatively, if we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the unexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a handful of stealth galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. A complete census of these objects will require deeper sky surveys, 30m-class follow-up telescopes, and more refined methods to identify extended, self-bound groupings of stars in the halo.},

abstract = {We present the first estimate of the Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function using blind spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, MUSE, in the Hubble Deep Field South. Using automatic source-detection software, we assemble a homogeneously-detected sample of 59 Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} emitters covering a flux range of -18.0 {\textless} log10 (F) {\textless} -16.3 (erg s{\^{}}-1 cm{\^{}}-2), corresponding to luminosities of 41.4 {\textless} log10 (L) {\textless} 42.8 (erg s{\^{}}-1). As recent studies have shown, Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} fluxes can be underestimated by a factor of two or more via traditional methods, and so we undertake a careful assessment of each object's Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux using a curve-of-growth analysis to account for extended emission. We describe our self-consistent method for determining the completeness of the sample, and present an estimate of the global Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function between redshifts 2.91 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.64 using the 1/Vmax estimator. We find the luminosity function is higher than many number densities reported in the literature by a factor of 2 - 3, although our result is consistent at the 1{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} level with most of these studies. Our observed luminosity function is also in good agreement with predictions from semi-analytic models, and shows no evidence for strong evolution between the high- and low-redshift halves of the data. We demonstrate that one's approach to Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux estimation does alter the observed luminosity function, and caution that accurate flux assessments will be crucial in measurements of the faint end slope. This is a pilot study for the Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function in the MUSE deep-fields, to be built on with data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field which will increase the size of our sample by almost a factor of 10.},

We present a search of large scale structure around a galaxy cluster core at {\$}z=2.095{\$} using a set of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. We find that both color-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) show significant overdensities around the {\$}z=2.095{\$} cluster. A total of 8 DSFGs (including 3 X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei, AGNs) and 34 SFGs are found within a 10 arcmin radius (corresponds to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}15 cMpc at {\$}z\backslashsim2.1{\$}) from the cluster center and within a redshift range of {\$}\backslashDelta z=0.02{\$}, which leads to galaxy overdensities of {\$}\backslashdelta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm DSFG{\}}\backslashsim12.3{\$} and {\$}\backslashdelta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFG{\}}\backslashsim2.8{\$}. The cluster core and the extended DSFG- and SFG-rich structure together demonstrate an active cluster formation phase, in which the cluster is accreting a significant amount of material from large scale structure while the more mature core may begin to virialize. Our finding of this DSFG-rich structure, along with a number of other protoclusters with excess DSFGs and AGNs found to date, suggest that the overdensities of these rare sources indeed trace significant mass overdensities. However, it remains puzzling how these intense star formers are triggered concurrently. Although an increased probability of galaxy interactions and/or enhanced gas supply can trigger the excess of DSFGs, our stacking analysis based on 850 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m images and morphological analysis based on rest-frame optical imaging do not show such enhancements of merger fraction and gas content in this structure.},

We find four principal results: Firstly that the population of objects classified as `peculiar' are intrinsically luminous in the optical ({\$}M{\_}B\backslashsim -19{\$}). Secondly these systems tend to be strong sources of [OII] line luminosity. Thirdly the optical-infrared colours of the faint population (a) confirm the presence of a population of compact blue galaxies and (b) show the stellar populations of Irregular/Peculiar galaxies encompass a wide range in age. Finally a surface-brightness comparison with the local galaxy sample of Frei et al shows that these objects are not of anomalously low surface brightness, rather we find that all morphological classes have evolved to a higher surface brightness at higher-redshifts ({\$}z{\textgreater}0.3{\$}).},

abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1um and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features NaI, CaII, and FeH at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals {\~{}}1{\%}. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L){\_}stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L){\_}stars values do not exceed dynamically-based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L){\_}stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a Milky Way IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

abstract = {Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale {\&} Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and 160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sol towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same mass range. [abridged]},

abstract = {Aims. The properties of dust attenuation at rest-frame UV wavelengths are inferred from very high-quality FORS2 spectra of 78 galaxies from the GMASS survey at redshift 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. These objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108 UV-luminous, intermediate-mass (i.e., with stellar masses similar to 10(10)-10(11) M-circle dot galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the FDF spectroscopic survey, the K20 survey, and the GDDS. Detection of the broad absorption feature centred on about 2175 angstrom ("UV bump") implies that the average UV extinction curve of a galaxy more closely resembles that of the Milky Way (MW) or the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and differs from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. The shape of the UV extinction curve is constrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame UV continuum with the support of a suite of models combining radiative transfer and stellar population synthesis. The UV bump is further characterised by fitting Lorentzian-like profiles. Results. Spectra exhibit a significant 2175 angstrom feature in at least 30{\%} of the cases, especially those suffering from substantial reddening. If attenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body via galactic winds or more localised superwinds, UV extinction curves in-between those of the SMC and LMC characterise UV-luminous, intermediate-mass galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The fraction of galaxies with extinction curves differing from the SMC one increases, if more dust resides in the galactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. On average, the width of the manifested UV bumps is about 60{\%} of the values typically measured along sightlines in the LMC and MW. This suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in the "supergiant" shell of ionised filaments LMC2, close to 30Dor. The presence of the carriers of the UV bump (probably organic carbon and amorphous silicates) at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 argues for outflows from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars being copious then. Consistent with their higher star-formation rates, the GMASS galaxies with a manifested UV bump are more luminous at rest-frame 8 mu m, where the emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (also products of AGB stars). In addition, they exhibit larger equivalent widths for prominent UV (metal) absorption features, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolved stellar populations. Conclusions. We conclude that diversification of the small-size dust component (responsible for the differential extinction at UV wavelengths and the emission at mid-IR wavelengths) has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that one sub-class of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is sufficiently both distinct and common to be classified separately from the bulk of SNe Ia, with a suggested class name of "type Iax supernovae" (SNe Iax), after SN 2002cx. However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study whether the population properties of this class might be understood if the events originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. In this potential progenitor population, a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) accumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star; ignition of that helium layer then leads to ignition of the CO WD. We incorporated detailed binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a binary population synthesis model to obtain rates and delay times for such events. The predicted Galactic event rate of these explosions is {\~{}}1.5$\backslash$times10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\{}yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} according to our standard model, in good agreement with the measured rates of SNe Iax. In addition, predicted delay times are {\~{}}70Myr-800Myr, consistent with the fact that most of SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. If the explosions are assumed to be double-detonations -- following current model expectations -- then based on the CO WD masses at explosion we also estimate the distribution of resulting SN brightness (-13 $\backslash$gtrsim M{\_}{\{}bol{\}} $\backslash$gtrsim -19mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of SNe Iax. We speculate on why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might lead to SNe Iax if similar systems with degenerate donors do not. We suggest that the high mass of the helium layer necessary for ignition at the lower accretion rates typically delivered from non-degenerate donors might be necessary to produce SN 2002cx-like characteristics, perhaps even by changing the nature of the CO ignition.},

The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented, that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope. We find a size distribution for the PAHs that results in emission band ratios consistent with observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for various intensities of the illuminating starlight. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7um emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing {\textless}1000 C atoms. We show how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submm and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction qpah, the lower cutoff Umin, and the fraction gamma of the dust heated by starlight with U{\textgreater}Umin. We present graphical procedures using IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate qpah, Umin, and gamma, the fraction f{\_}PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U{\textgreater}100, and the total dust mass Mdust.},

The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by v{\_}Si (defined as "Normal" and "High-Velocity"). We verify this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B-V) {\textgreater} 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (B{\_}max - V{\_}max) - M{\_}V plane, (2) the B{\_}max - V{\_}max cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.07 mag to the red in B{\_}max - V{\_}max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are {\~{}}0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with A{\_}V {\textless} 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R{\_}V found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

abstract = {Published B and V fluxes from nearby Type Ia supernovae are fitted to light-curve templates with 4-6 adjustable parameters. Separately, B magnitudes from the same sample are fitted to a linear dependence on B-V color within a post-maximum time window prescribed by the CMAGIC method. These fits yield two independent SN magnitude estimates B{\_}max and B{\_}BV. Their difference varies systematically with decline rate Delta m{\_}15 in a form that is compatible with a bilinear but not a linear dependence; a nonlinear form likely describes the decline-rate dependence of B{\_}max itself. A Hubble fit to the average of B{\_}max and B{\_}BV requires a systematic correction for observed B-V color that can be described by a linear coefficient R = 2.59 +- 0.24, well below the coefficient R{\_}B {\~{}} 4.1 commonly used to characterize the effects of Milky Way dust. At 99.9{\%} confidence the data reject a simple model in which no color correction is required for SNe that are clustered at the blue end of their observed color distribution. After systematic corrections are performed, B{\_}max and B{\_}BV exhibit mutual rms intrinsic variation equal to 0.074 +- 0.019 mag, of which at least an equal share likely belongs to B{\_}BV. SN magnitudes measured using maximum-luminosity or CMAGIC methods show comparable rms deviations of order {\~{}} 0.14 mag from the Hubble line. The same fit also establishes a 95{\%} confidence upper limit of 486 km/s on the rms peculiar velocity of nearby SNe relative to the Hubble flow.},

abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at $\lambda${\textgreater}5 $\mu$m and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at $\lambda${\textgreater}200 $\mu$m is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z{\textgreater}1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z{\~{}}0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80{\%} of the 140 $\mu$m CIRB is produced at 0{\textless}z{\textless}1.5, while only about 30{\%} of the 850 $\mu$m background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+0.12-0.1 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, and remains almost constant up to z{\~{}}2. At least 70{\%} of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with LIR{\textgreater}1011 Lsolar. The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z{\textgreater}2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z{\~{}}3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z{\~{}}4.},

We find that this transitionary species of galaxy is rare at all redshifts, contributing {\~{}}5{\%} of the total population at z{\~{}}2, to {\textless}1{\%} by z{\~{}}0.5. By comparing the mass functions of quiescent galaxies to post-starburst galaxies at three cosmic epochs, we show that rapid quenching of star formation can account for 100{\%} of quiescent galaxy formation, if the post-starburst spectral features are visible for {\~{}}250Myr. The flattening of the low mass end of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function seen at z{\~{}}1 can be entirely explained by the addition of rapidly quenched galaxies. Only if a significant fraction of post-starburst galaxies have features that are visible for longer than 250Myr, or they acquire new gas and return to the star-forming sequence, can there be significant growth of the red sequence from a slower quenching route. The shape of the mass function of these transitory post-starburst galaxies resembles that of quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}2, with a preferred stellar mass of logM{\~{}}10.6, but evolves steadily to resemble that of star-forming galaxies at z{\textless}1. This leads us to propose a dual origin for post-starburst galaxies: (1) at z{\textgreater}2 they are exclusively massive galaxies that have formed the bulk of their stars during a rapid assembly period, followed by complete quenching of further star formation, (2) at z{\textless}1 they are caused by the rapid quenching of gas-rich star-forming galaxies, independent of stellar mass, possibly due to environment and/or gas-rich major mergers.},

We explore the effects of different feedback prescriptions (supernova driven galactic winds and AGN feedback), initial stellar mass functions and metal cooling.

For a strategic survey of such galaxies and the interpretation of the obtained data, this paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from Ly$\alpha$ to the rest-frame 1 ?m as a function of metallicity from zero to the solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent widths of Ly$\alpha$, He II$\lambda$1640, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and [O III]$\lambda$5007 to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O III]$\lambda$5007 to H$\beta$ {\textless} 0.1 as the most robust criterion for {\textless}1/1000 of the solar metallicity. This ratio of a galaxy with a few Mȯ yr-1 at z˜ 8 is detectable by spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope within a reasonable exposure time.},

The ultraviolet{\`{E}}optical rest-frame SEDs of the galaxies are much bluer than those of present-day spiral and elliptical galaxies and are generally similar to those of local star-burst galaxies with modest amounts of reddening. We use stellar population synthesis models to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from LBGs. Under the assumption that the star for-mation rate is continuous or decreasing with time, the best-Ðtting models provide a lower bound on the LBG mass estimates. LBGs with " " L * {\"{I}}{\"{I}} UV luminosities are estimated to have minimum stellar masses D1010 or roughly 1/10 that of a present-day L * galaxy, similar to the mass of the Milky Way M {\_} , bulge. By considering the photometric e ects of a second stellar population component of maximally old stars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is D3{\`{E}}8 times the minimum mass estimate. The stellar masses derived for bright LBGs are similar to published estimates of their dynamical masses based on nebular emission line widths, suggesting that such kinematic measurements may substantially underestimate the total masses of the dark matter halos. We Ðnd only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages, extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star formation histories. Most LBGs are well Ðtted by models with population ages that range from 30 Myr to D1 Gyr, although for models with subsolar metallicities a signiÐcant minority of galaxies are well Ðtted by very young ([10 Myr), very dusty stellar populations, A(1700 mag.

We also Ðnd that the typical ages for the observed star formation events are signiÐcantly younger than the time interval covered by this red-shift range (D1.5 Gyr). From this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent, non{\`{E}}star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the NICMOS data that might correspond to the fading remnants of galaxies formed at higher redshift, we suggest that star formation in LBGs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and a timescale between star formation events of Gyr.},

We compare our cleaning procedure with the foreground modeling used by the Planck team and find good agreement.

We show evidence suggesting residual systematics in the detector set spectra used in the Planck likelihood code, which is substantially reduced for our spectra.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We combine NUV, optical and IR imaging of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 to explore the properties of the dust both in the interstellar medium of the galaxy and the dust entrained in the superwind. The three NUV filters of Swift/UVOT enable us to probe in detail the properties of the extinction curve in the region around the 2175A bump. The NUV colour-colour diagram strongly rules out a Calzetti-type law, which can either reflect intrinsic changes in the dust properties or in the star formation history compared to starbursts well represented by such an attenuation law. We emphasize that it is mainly in the NUV region where a standard Milky-Way-type law is preferred over a Calzetti law. The age and dust distribution of the stellar populations is consistent with the scenario of an encounter with M81 in the recent 400 Myr. The radial gradients of the NUV and optical colours in the superwind region support the hypothesis that the emission in the wind cone is driven by scattering from dust grains entrained in the ejecta. The observed wavelength dependence reveals either a grain size distribution {\$}n(a)\backslashpropto a{\^{}}{\{}-2.5{\}}{\$}, where {\$}a{\$} is the size of the grain, or a flatter distribution with a maximum size cutoff, suggesting that only small grains are entrained in the supernovae-driven wind.},

abstract = {Photometric measurements show that as a group nearby type Ia supernovae follow similar lightcurves and reach similar peak magnitudes Thus, these supernovae can serve as standard candles or calibrated candles at cosmological distances. Magnitudes of local and distant supernovae, both in the same filter band, are compared using a {\$}K{\$} correction to account for the different spectral regions incident on that filter. A generalized approach compares magnitudes in different bands for the nearby and distant supernova, bands that are selected to give sensitivity in corresponding regions of the redshifted and unredshifted spectra. Thus at a redshift of {\$}z \backslashapprox 0.5{\$}, local {\$}B{\$} magnitudes are compared with distant {\$}R{\$} magnitudes. We compute these generalized {\$}K{\$} corrections over a range of redshifts and bandpass pairs and discuss their advantages over the traditional single-band {\$}K{\$} correction. In particular, errors near maximum light can be kept below 0.05 mag out to at least {\$}z=0.6{\$}, whereas the traditional {\$}K{\$} correction is difficult to use beyond {\$}z {\textgreater} 0.2{\$}.},

abstract = {The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) consists of a complete sample of 202 Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) selected from the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The galaxies span the full range of interaction stages, from isolated galaxies to interacting pairs to late stage mergers. We present a comparison of the UV and infrared properties of 135 galaxies in GOALS observed by GALEX and Spitzer. For interacting galaxies with separations greater than the resolution of GALEX and Spitzer (2-6"), we assess the UV and IR properties of each galaxy individually. The contribution of the FUV to the measured SFR ranges from 0.2{\%} to 17.9{\%}, with a median of 2.8{\%} and a mean of 4.0 +/- 0.4{\%}. The specific star formation rate of the GOALS sample is extremely high, with a median value (3.9*10{\^{}}{\{}-10{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) that is comparable to the highest specific star formation rates seen in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey sample. We examine the position of each galaxy on the IR excess-UV slope (IRX-beta) diagram as a function of galaxy properties, including IR luminosity and interaction stage. The LIRGs on average have greater IR excesses than would be expected based on their UV colors if they obeyed the same relations as starbursts with L{\_}IR {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}0 or normal late-type galaxies. The ratio of L{\_}IR to the value one would estimate from the IRXg-beta relation published for lower luminosity starburst galaxies ranges from 0.2 to 68, with a median value of 2.7. A minimum of 19{\%} of the total IR luminosity in the RBGS is produced in LIRGs and ULIRGs with red UV colors (beta {\textgreater} 0). Among resolved interacting systems, 32{\%} contain one galaxy which dominates the IR emission while the companion dominates the UV emission. Only 21{\%} of the resolved systems contain a single galaxy which dominates both wavelengths.},

abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10{\^{}}10(10{\^{}}10.8) Msun at z{\textless}0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFR) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 micron photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence (MS)", with a limited range of SFR at a given M* and z (1 sigma {\textless} +-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log(M*). The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF, and the effect of mergers on SFR. Typical galaxies spend {\~{}}67(95){\%} of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\~{}} 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z{\~{}}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFR are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z{\~{}}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs star formation prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

We find no dependence of the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation with environment probing up to group scale masses.

SFR functions provide a more physical description of galaxy buildup at high redshift and allow for direct comparisons to SFRs at lower redshifts determined by a variety of techniques. Our SFR functions are derived from well-established z {\~{}} 4-7 UV LFs, UV-continuum slope trends with redshift and luminosity, and infrared excess (IRX)-beta relations. They are well described by Schechter relations. We extend the comparison baseline for SFR functions to z {\~{}} 2 by considering recent determinations of the Halpha and mid-IR LFs. The low-end slopes of the SFR functions are flatter than for the UV LFs, Deltaalpha {\~{}} +0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time (z {\~{}} 0-7). In addition, we find that the characteristic value SFR* from the Schechter fit to the SFR function exhibits consistent, and substantial, linear growth as a function of redshift from {\~{}}5 M {\&}sun; yr-1 at z {\~{}} 8, 650 Myr after the big bang, to {\~{}}100 M {\&}sun; yr-1 at z {\~{}} 2, {\~{}}2.5 Gyr later. Recent results at z {\~{}} 10, close to the onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. The uniformity of this evolution is even greater than seen in the UV LF over the redshift range z {\~{}} 2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. These results provide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 Gyr of cosmic time.},

abstract = {We combine H-alpha emission-line and infrared continuum measurements of two samples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). We use a simple energy balance based method that has been applied previously to HII regions in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. We find that our composite H-alpha+IR based SFRs are in excellent agreement with attenuation-corrected SFRs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over the full range of SFRs (0.01 -- 80 solar mass per year) and attenuations (0 -- 2.5 mag) studied. We find that the combination of H-alpha and total infrared luminosities provides the most robust SFR measurements, but combinations of H-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micron perform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those obtained for HII regions (Calzetti et al. 2007), with the difference attributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our results are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `IR cirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same methodology can be applied to [OII]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}3727 emission-line measurements, and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of IR fluxes when the latter are not available. We assess the precision and systematic reliability of all of these composite methods.},

abstract = {In order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass-distribution, some process must be responsible for the suppression of star-formation in the most massive of galaxies. Commonly Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are invoked to fulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of much debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and enhancement of star-formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE and NMBS galaxy surveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashge{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), high-luminosity (L{\$}{\_}{\{}1.4{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}24{\}}{\$} W Hz{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) sample of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei to a redshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low redshift studies, which associate radio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1.5 radio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations of radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find the radio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 {\$}\backslashle{\$} z {\$}{\textless}{\$} 2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on redshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the radio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} or a halo-mass of 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. This halo-mass threshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN feedback at this mass limit. Despite this we find that radio-AGN host star-formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy sample, suggesting that while radio-AGN are in the right place to suppress star-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible for doing so.},

abstract = {A large fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) may host planets in their habitable zones. These planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on a transiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between the Earth-sized WD and its Earth-sized planets. The JWST is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known planets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that is capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We propose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS imaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large field of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs can be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits. Our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will find up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain Kepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With few-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a completely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is sensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and substellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the double WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the gravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our targets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit from high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit survey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby M dwarfs or asteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae) in the same fields.},

abstract = {We study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using data from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. The sample is selected at a constant number density of n=2x10{\^{}}-4 Mpc{\^{}}-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of {\~{}}2 since z=2, following the relation log(M)=11.45-0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images at redshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of {\~{}}28.5 mag/arcsec{\^{}}2. We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpc has increased by a factor of {\~{}}4 since z=2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r{\_}e{\~{}}(1+z){\^{}}-1.3 and n{\~{}}(1+z){\^{}}-1.0 respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for {\~{}}20{\%} of the mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008). We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557 supernovae, the Union2 compilation.

@article{Alibert2014,
abstract = {Context. The conditions that a planet must fulfill to be habitable are not precisely known. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a planet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it can help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones should be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Aims: Assuming, as in the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for long-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a radius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum radius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions compatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom of a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these two constraints cannot be met. Methods: We compute internal structure models of planets, using a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and atmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in particular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Results: Our results show that for planets in the super-Earth mass range (1-12 M⊕), the maximum that a planet, with a composition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2 R⊕. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si ratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope structure. Conclusions: These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass determinations using high-precision transit observations like those that will soon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which planets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be considered as best targets for further habitability studies.},

We demonstrate, using stacked X-ray data and a subset of galaxies with H-alpha measurements, that L(5-8.5) provides a reliable estimate of L(IR) for most star forming galaxies at z{\~{}}2. The range of L(IR) in the samples considered extends from {\~{}}1e10 to {\textgreater}1e12 Lsun, with a mean of 2e11 Lsun. Using 24 micron observations to infer dust extinction in high redshift galaxies, we find that, as in the local universe, the obscuration (L[IR]/L[1600]) is strongly dependent on L(bol), and ranges in value from {\textless}1 to $\backslash${\~{}}1000. However, the obscuration is {\~{}}10 times smaller at a given L(bol) at z{\~{}}2 than at z=0. We show that the values of L(IR) and obscuration inferred from the UV spectral slope beta generally agree well with the values inferred from L(5-8.5) for L(bol){\textless}1e12 Lsun. For galaxies with L(bol){\textgreater}1e12 Lsun, it is common for UV-based estimates to underpredict L(IR) by a factor of {\~{}}10-100. Using the specific SFR as a proxy for cold gas fraction, we find a wide range in the evolutionary state of galaxies at z{\~{}}2, from those which have just begun to form stars to those which have already accumulated most of their stellar mass and are about to become, or already are, passively-evolving.

Here, we report that the spectral diversity of SNe Ia is tied to their birthplace environments. We found that those with high-velocity ejecta are substantially more concentrated in the inner and brighter regions of their host galaxies than are normal-velocity SNe Ia. Furthermore, the former tend to inhabit larger and more luminous hosts. These results suggest that high-velocity SNe Ia likely originate from relatively younger and more metal-rich progenitors than do normal-velocity SNe Ia and are restricted to galaxies with substantial chemical evolution.},

We use a sample of 58 star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) at z{\textless}0.2, for which there is a rich suite of multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through to the infrared. The data from the Spitzer infrared spectrograph (IRS) of these galaxies, which spans 5-40 micron, is anchored to their photometric counterparts. The spectral region between 40-70 micron is interpolated using dust model fits to the IRS spectrum and Spitzer 70 and 160 micron photometry. Since there are no sharp spectral features in this region, we expect these interpolations to be robust. This spectral range is calibrated as a SFR diagnostic using several reference SFR indicators to mitigate potential bias. Our band-specific continuous SFR indicators are found to be consistent with monochromatic calibrations in the local universe, as derived from Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel photometry. Our local composite template and continuous SFR diagnostics are made available for public use through the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and have typical dispersions of 30{\%} or less. We discuss the validity and range of applicability for our SFR indicators in the context of unveiling the formation and evolution of galaxies. Additionally, in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope this will become a flexible tool, applicable to any SFG up to z{\~{}}3.},

During this period, the star-formation activity in the Universe was at its peak level, and the structural patterns observed among galaxies in the local Universe were not yet in place. A variety of novel techniques have been employed over the past decade to assemble multiwavelength observations of galaxies during this impor-tant epoch. In this primarily observational review, I present a census of the methods used to find distant galaxies and the empirical constraints on their multiwavelength luminosities and colors. I then discuss what is known about the stellar content and past histories of star formation in high-redshift galax-ies; their interstellar contents including dust, gas, and heavy elements; and their structural and dynamical properties. I conclude by considering some of the most pressing and open questions regarding the physics of high-redshift galaxies, which are to be addressed with future facilities. 525},

Measures of opacity in local galaxies are reviewed together with widely used theoretical and empirical methods for quantifying its effects. Existing evidence shows that the dust content of nearby galaxies depends not only on their morphology, but also on their luminosity and activity level. A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength datasets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate and high redshift galaxies. This, in turn, limits the reliability of inferred physical quantities, such as star formation rates, stellar population ages, galaxy luminosity functions, and others.},

abstract = {The multiplexing capability of slitless spectroscopy is a powerful asset in creating large spectroscopic datasets, but issues such as spectral confusion make the interpretation of the data challenging. Here we present a new method to search for emission lines in the slitless spectroscopic data from the 3D-HST survey utilizing the Wide-Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Using a novel statistical technique, we can detect compact (extended) emission lines at 90{\%} completeness down to fluxes of 1.5 (3.0) times 10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}} erg/s/cm{\^{}}2, close to the noise level of the grism exposures, for objects detected in the deep ancillary photometric data. Unlike previous methods, the Bayesian nature allows for probabilistic line identifications, namely redshift estimates, based on secondary emission line detections and/or photometric redshift priors. As a first application, we measure the comoving number density of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (restframe [O III] 5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 Angstroms). We find that these galaxies are more than 10 times more common above z{\~{}}1.5 than at z{\textless}0.5. With upcoming large grism surveys such as Euclid and WFIRST, methods like the one presented here will be crucial for constructing emission line redshift catalogs in an automated and well-understood manner.},

abstract = {Abstract To be habitable, a world (planet or moon) does not need to be located in the stellar habitable zone (HZ), and worlds in the HZ are not necessarily habitable. Here, we illustrate how tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ. Scientists have developed a language that neglects the possible existence of worlds that offer more benign environments to life than Earth does. We call these objects "superhabitable" and discuss in which contexts this term could be used, that is to say, which worlds tend to be more habitable than Earth. In an appendix, we show why the principle of mediocracy cannot be used to logically explain why Earth should be a particularly habitable planet or why other inhabited worlds should be Earth-like. Superhabitable worlds must be considered for future follow-up observations of signs of extraterrestrial life. Considering a range of physical effects, we conclude that they will tend to be slightly older and more massive than Earth and that their host stars will likely be K dwarfs. This makes Alpha Centauri B, which is a member of the closest stellar system to the Sun and is supposed to host an Earth-mass planet, an ideal target for searches for a superhabitable world.

Given the depth and area of ASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies extrapolating the Meurer z{\~{}}0 IRX-beta relation to z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 (assuming T{\_}d{\~{}}35 K). However, only 6 tentative detections are found at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 in ASPECS, with just three at {\textgreater}3sigma. Subdividing z=2-10 galaxies according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and UV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we only find a significant detection in the most massive ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}9.75 Msol) subsample, with an infrared excess (IRX=L{\_}{\{}IR{\}}/L{\_}{\{}UV{\}}) consistent with previous z{\~{}}2 results. However, the infrared excess we measure from our large selection of sub-L* ({\textless}10{\^{}}9.75 Msol) galaxies is 0.11(-0.42)(+0.32) and 0.14(-0.14)(+0.15) at z=2-3 and z=4-10, respectively, lying below even an SMC IRX-beta relation (95{\%} confidence). These results demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR luminosity of z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 galaxies. We furthermore find that the evolution of the IRX-stellar mass relationship depends on the evolution of the dust temperature. If the dust temperature increases monotonically with redshift (as (1+z){\^{}}0.32) such that T{\_}d{\~{}}44-50 K at z{\textgreater}=4, current results are suggestive of little evolution in this relationship to z{\~{}}6. We use these results to revisit recent estimates of the z{\textgreater}{\~{}}3 SFR density. One less obvious implication is in interpreting the high Halpha EWs seen in z{\~{}}5 galaxies: our results imply that star-forming galaxies produce Lyman-continuum photons at twice the efficiency (per unit UV luminosity) as implied in conventional models. Star-forming galaxies can then reionize the Universe, even if the escape fraction is {\textless}10{\%}.},

To do this we have cross-correlated IRAS images and GALEX observations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas (CO and HI) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. We find that attenuation correlates with metallicity. We then use the UV profiles, corrected for attenuation, to study several variants of the Schmidt law and conclude that our results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of Kennicutt but extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerable scatter. We do not detect an abrupt break in the UV light at the threshold radius derived from H-alpha data (at which the H-alpha profile shows a break and beyond which only a few HII regions are usually found). We interpret the H-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as often suggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars corresponding to low levels of star formation.},

The sample was selected in the far-IR, at $\backslash$lambda=100 and/or 160 $\backslash$mu m, and only includes galaxies with a secure H$\backslash$alpha detection (S/N{\textgreater}3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured z and F(H$\backslash$alpha) for the whole sample, rescaling the observed flux by a constant factor of 1.2 to remove the contamination by [NII]. The stellar masses, infrared and UV luminosities were derived from the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE500 $\backslash$mu m. We derived the continuum extinction Estar(B-V) from both the IRX ratio and the UV-slope, and found an excellent agreement among them. Galaxies in the sample have 2.6x10{\^{}}9{\$}\backslashleq{\$}M*{\$}\backslashleq{\$}3.5x10{\^{}}11 Msun, intense infrared luminosity (L{\_}IR{\textgreater}1.2x10{\^{}}10 Lsun), high level of dust obscuration (0.1{\$}\backslashleq{\$}Estar(B-V){\$}\backslashleq{\$}1.1) and strong H$\backslash$alpha emission (typical observed fluxes Fobs(H$\backslash$alpha){\$}\backslashgeq{\$}4.1x10{\^{}}-17 erg/s/cm2). The nebular extinction was estimated by comparing the observed SFR{\_}H$\backslash$alpha and the SFR{\_}UV. We obtained f=Estar(B-V)/Eneb(B-V)=0.93{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.06, i.e. higher than the value measured in the local Universe. This result could be partially due to the adopted selection criteria, picking up the most obscured but also the H$\backslash$alpha brightest sources. The derived dust correction produces a good agreement between H$\backslash$alpha and IR+UV SFRs for objects with SFR{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}20 Msun/yr and M*{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}5x10{\^{}}10 Msun, while sources with lower SFR and M* seem to require a smaller f-factor (i.e. higher H$\backslash$alpha extinction correction). Our results then imply that for our sample the nebular and optical-UV extinctions are comparable and suggest that the f-factor is a function of both M* and SFR, according with previous studies.},

abstract = {We present SiFTO, a new empirical method for modeling type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. We make use of high-redshift SN observations when training the model, allowing us to extend it bluer than rest frame U. This increases the utility of our high-redshift SN observations by allowing us to use more of the available data. We find that when the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription, applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description. SiFTO therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies different stretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter and the stretch in the rest-frame B band. We compare SiFTO to other published light-curve models by applying them to the same set of SN photometry, and demonstrate that SiFTO and SALT2 perform better than the alternatives when judged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. We further demonstrate that when SiFTO and SALT2 are trained on the same data set the cosmological results agree.},

abstract = {We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential, lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating that the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2 for a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high ionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter (U) between -2.25 {\textless} log(U) {\textless} -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities are greater than 0.5 Z{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We derive ionization fractions for the transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.},

abstract = {The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) allows for the first time a highly significant census of environments and structures up to redshift one, as well as a full morphological description of the galaxy population. In this paper we present a study aimed to constrain the evolution, in the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, of the mass content of different morphological types and its dependence on the environmental density. We use a deep multicolor catalog, covering an area of {\~{}}0.7 square degrees inside the COSMOS field, with accurate photometric redshifts (i {\textless} 26.5 and dz/(z+1) {\~{}} 0.035). We estimate galaxy stellar masses by fitting the multi-color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population models. We quantitatively describe the galaxy morphology by fitting PSF convolved Sersic profiles to the galaxy surface brightness distributions down to F814 = 24 mag for a sample of 41300 objects.   We confirm an evolution of the morphological mix with redshift: the higher the redshift the more disk-dominated galaxies become important. We find that the morphological mix is a function of the local comoving density: the morphology density relation extends up to the highest redshift explored.   The stellar mass function of disk-dominated galaxies is consistent with being constant with redshift. Conversely, the stellar mass function of bulge-dominated systems shows a decline in normalization with redshift. Such different behaviors of late-types and early-types stellar mass functions naturally set the redshift evolution of the transition mass. ABRIDGED},

abstract = {Understanding galaxy formation and evolution requires studying the interplay between the growth of galaxies and the growth of their black holes across cosmic time. Here we explore a sample of Ha-selected star-forming galaxies from the HiZELS survey and use the wealth of multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field (X-rays, far-infrared and radio) to study the relative growth rates between typical galaxies and their central supermassive black holes, from z=2.23 to z=0. Typical star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1-2 have black hole accretion rates (BHARs) of 0.001-0.01 Msun/yr and star formation rates (SFRs) of {\~{}}10-40 Msun/yr, and thus grow their stellar mass much quicker than their black hole mass ({\~{}}3.3 orders of magnitude faster). However, {\~{}}3{\%} of the sample (the sources detected directly in the X-rays) show a significantly quicker growth of the black hole mass (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude quicker growth than the typical sources). BHARs fall from z=2.23 to z=0, with the decline resembling that of star formation rate density or the typical SFR. We find that the average black hole to galaxy growth (BHAR/SFR) is approximately constant for star-forming galaxies in the last 11 Gyrs. The relatively constant BHAR/SFR suggests that these two quantities evolve equivalently through cosmic time and with practically no delay between the two.},

Together, this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars are being formed. We find the Halpha morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the ACS I band than in the WFC3 H band, especially for the larger systems. We next derive a novel prescription for Halpha dust corrections, which accounts for extra extinction towards HII regions. The prescription leads to consistent SFR estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the Halpha/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel and on a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of star formation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this relation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced Halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific star formation rates compared to the underlying disk. Their Halpha/UV luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the ACS clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust. Our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories.},

Comparing to the Guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicates that quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-forming centrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. We use a simple toy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces the observed quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass between star-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenching probability that increases with halo mass from {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0 for {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}h/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim{\$}11 to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 for {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}h/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim{\$}13.5. A single halo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction and satellite distribution of centrals. Therefore, while halo quenching may be an important mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. It remains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even in relatively massive halos.},

abstract = {We present an updated version of the Multicolor Light Curve Shape method to measure distances to type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), incorporating new procedures for K-correction and extinction corrections. We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust, and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SN Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz {\textgreater}= 2500 km/s), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7{\%} in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SN Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find the Hubble flow supernovae with Hd {\textgreater}= 7400 km/s yield an expansion rate that is 6.5 +/- 1.8{\%} lower than the rate determined from supernovae within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SN Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Direct fits of SN Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest their mean extinction law may be described by R{\_}V {\~{}}= 2.7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R{\_}V.},

abstract = {We present an exhaustive, quantitative comparison of all of the known extinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with our understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The R{\_}V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve which was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give R{\_}V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R{\_}V, and behavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R{\_}V. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction curves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC Bar. (abridged)},

From this, we construct a mass-complete (log(M{\$}{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$}/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) {\$}\backslashge{\$} 9.75), AGN luminosity limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U - V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of the AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using 160{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate of AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.07 dex with respect to the control sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much as a factor of {\~{}}5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.},

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

abstract = {Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting in the far-infrared (FIR) is greatly limited by a dearth of data and an excess of free parameters - from galaxies' dust composition, temperature, mass, orientation, opacity, to heating from AGN. This paper presents a simple FIR SED fitting technique joining a modified, single dust temperature greybody, representing the reprocessed starburst emission in the whole galaxy, to a mid-infrared powerlaw, which approximates hot-dust emission from AGN heating or clumpy, hot starbursting regions. This FIR SED can be used to measure infrared luminosities, dust temperatures and dust masses for both local and high-z galaxies with 3 to 10+ FIR photometric measurements. This fitting method is compared to infrared template SEDs in the literature using photometric data on 65 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, (U)LIRGs. Despite relying only on 2-4 free parameters, the coupled greybody/powerlaw SED fitting described here produces better fits to photometric measurements than best-fit literature template SEDs (with residuals a factor of {\~{}}2 lower). A mean emissivity index of beta=1.60+-0.38 and mid-infrared powerlaw slope of alpha=2.0+-0.5 is measured; the former agrees with the widely presumed emissivity index of beta=1.5 and the latter is indicative of an optically-thin dust medium with a shallow radial density profile, {\~{}}r{\^{}}-0.5. Adopting characteristic dust temperature as the inverse wavelength where the SED peaks, dust temperatures {\~{}}25-45K are measured for local (U)LIRGs, {\~{}}5-15K colder than previous estimates using only simple greybodies. This comparative study highlights the impact of SED fitting assumptions on the measurement of physical properties such as infrared luminosity (and thereby infrared-based star formation rate), dust temperature and dust mass, for both local and high-redshift galaxies.

abstract = {We present deep near-infrared spectra for a sample of 24 quiescent galaxies in the redshift range 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 obtained with the MOSFIRE spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory. In conjunction with a similar dataset we obtained in the range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 with the LRIS spectrograph, we analyze the kinematic and structural properties for 80 quiescent galaxies, the largest homogeneously-selected sample to date spanning 3 Gyr of early cosmic history. Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated HST images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z{\~{}}2. By classifying our sample according to Sersic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. Although this ratio between dynamical and stellar mass is roughly constant with redshift for the total quiescent population, we see a redshift evolution for the subset of spheroidal systems. By matching galaxies at fixed velocity dispersion, we are able to connect descendants with their earlier progenitors thereby determining the growth in size for quiescent galaxies over two distinct redshift ranges for the first time. We measure a size growth rate of 0.13 dex/Gyr over 1.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 which contrasts with a rate of only 0.03 dex/Gyr over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3. We discuss the physical origin of this time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the systematic rotation.},

Here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sersic indices, {\$}n{\$}, of galaxies across the SFR-M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} plane. We use a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$} selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs.

While the slope of the log(SFR)-log(M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}) relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with {\$}n{\textgreater}2{\$} (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} than the main ridgeline of the star-formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At {\$}z{\textless}1{\$}, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}, decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.},

abstract = {A large sample of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1.4 {\textless}= z spec {\textless}= 3.7, with complementary imaging in the near- and mid-IR from the ground and from the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope, is used to infer the average star formation histories (SFHs) of typical galaxies from z {\~{}} 2 to 7. For a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5 {\textless}= z spec {\textless} 2.6, we perform a detailed comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that are 5-10 times lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may not be accurate for typical galaxies at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2. The SFRs of z {\~{}} 2-3 galaxies are directly proportional to their stellar masses (M *), with unity slope—a result that is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint ({\{}$\backslash$cal R{\}}{\textgreater}25.5) galaxies—for M * {\textgreater}{\~{}} 5 × 108 M ⊙ and SFRs {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2 M ⊙ yr-1. We interpret this result in the context of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the SFR-M * relation. The average specific SFRs at z {\~{}} 2-3 are remarkably similar within a factor of two to those measured at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4, implying that the average SFH is one where SFRs increase with time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (1) a substantial fraction of UV-bright z {\~{}} 2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4; and (2) gas masses must increase with time from z = 2 to 7, over which time the net cold gas accretion rate—as inferred from the specific SFR and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation—is {\~{}}2-3 times larger than the SFR. However, if we evolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to host L* galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, then we find that {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\%} of the baryons accreted onto typical halos at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These results highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early cosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.  Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

abstract = {Although the optical colour-magnitude diagram of galaxies allows one to select red sequence objects, neither can it be used for galaxy classification without additional observational data such as spectra or high-resolution images, nor to identify blue galaxies at unknown redshifts. We show that adding the near ultraviolet colour to the optical CMD reveals a tight relation in the three-dimensional colour-colour-magnitude space smoothly continuing from the "blue cloud" to the "red sequence". We found that 98 per cent of 225,000 low-redshift (Z{\textless}0.27) galaxies follow a smooth surface g-r=F(M,NUV-r) with a standard deviation of 0.03-0.07 mag making it the tightest known galaxy photometric relation. There is a strong correlation between morphological types and integrated NUV-r colours. Rare galaxy classes such as E+A or tidally stripped systems become outliers that occupy distinct regions in the 3D parameter space. Using stellar population models for galaxies with different SFHs, we show that (a) the (NUV-r, g-r) distribution is formed by objects having constant and exponentially declining SFR with different characteristic timescales; (b) colour evolution for exponentially declining models goes along the relation suggesting its weak evolution up-to a redshift of 0.9; (c) galaxies with truncated SFHs have very short transition phase offset from the relation thus explaining the rareness of E+A galaxies. This relation can be used as a powerful galaxy classification tool when morphology remains unresolved. Its mathematical consequence is the photometric redshift estimates from 3 broad-band photometric points. This approach works better than most existing photometric redshift techniques applied to multi-colour datasets. Therefore, the relation can be used as an efficient selection technique for galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.3{\textless}Z{\textless}0.8) using optical imaging surveys.},

The sources are selected from HST/ACS+WFC3/IR data over the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), two HUDF parallel fields, and wide area data over the CANDELS/GOODS-South. The new Spitzer/IRAC data increase the coverage in [3.6] and [4.5] to {\~{}}120h over the HUDF reaching depths of {\~{}}28 (AB,1$\sigma$). The improved depth and inclusion of brighter candidates result in direct {\textgreater}=3$\sigma$ InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) detections of 20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at {\textgreater}=5$\sigma$. The average [3.6]-[4.5] colors of IRAC detected galaxies at z {\~{}} 8 are markedly redder than those at z {\~{}} 7, observed only 130 Myr later. The simplest explanation is that we witness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$) moving through the IRAC bandpasses with redshift. Assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z {\~{}} 7 and z {\~{}} 8 we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of {\{}W{\}}{\_}{\{}[O$\backslash$,$\backslash$scriptsize{\{}III{\}}]$\backslash$ $\backslash$lambda $\backslash$lambda 4959,5007+H$\backslash$beta {\}}=670{\^{}}{\{}+260{\}}{\_}{\{}-170{\}} {\AA} contributing 0.56{\^{}}{\{}+0.16{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.11{\}} mag to the [4.5] filter at z {\~{}} 8.

abstract = {In providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe, the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) has observed 71 high-z Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared bands Y and J. These can be used to construct rest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yield distance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-rate corrections than in the optical. However, working with NIR observed and i-band rest-frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24 high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in the Hubble flow is used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions are not dominated by the Hubble flow.},

abstract = {We report the results from some of the deepest Keck/MOSFIRE data yet obtained for candidate {\$}z \backslashgtrsim 7{\$} galaxies.

abstract = {The relation between the ratio of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) flux densities (the infrared excess: IRX) and the slope of the UV spectrum ($\backslash$beta) of galaxies plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of the dust attenuation of star forming galaxies especially at high redshifts. Many authors, however, pointed out that there is a significant dispersion and/or deviation from the originally proposed IRX-$\backslash$beta relation depending on sample selection. We reexamined the IRX-$\backslash$beta relation by measuring the far- and near-UV flux densities of the original sample galaxies with GALEX and AKARI imaging data, and constructed a revised formula. We found that the newly obtained IRX values were lower than the original relation because of the significant underestimation of the UV flux densities of the galaxies, caused by the small aperture of IUE, Further, since the original relation was based on IRAS data which covered a wavelength range of $\backslash$lambda = 42--122$\backslash$mum, using the data from AKARI which has wider wavelength coverage toward longer wavelengths, we obtained an appropriate IRX-$\backslash$beta relation with total dust emission (TIR): $\backslash$log(L{\_}{\{}$\backslash$rm TIR{\}}/L{\_}{\{}$\backslash$rm FUV{\}}) = $\backslash$log [10{\^{}}{\{}0.4(3.06+1.58$\backslash$beta){\}}-1] +0.22. This new relation is consistent with most of the preceding results for samples selected at optical and UV, though there is a significant scatter around it. We also found that even the quiescent class of IR galaxies follows this new relation, though luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies distribute completely differently as well known before.},

Whilst SN 2010O remains undetected at radio frequencies, SN 2010P was detected (with an astrometric accuracy better than 1 milli arcsec in position) in its optically thin phase in epochs ranging from {\~{}}1 to {\~{}}3yr after its explosion date, indicating a very slow radio evolution and a strong interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium. Our late-time radio observations toward SN 2010P probe the dense circumstellar envelope of this SN, and imply a mass-loss rate (Msun/yr) to wind velocity (in units of 10 km/s) ratio of (3.0-5.1)E-05, with a 5 GHz peak luminosity of {\~{}}1.2E+27 erg/s/Hz on day {\~{}}464 after explosion.

abstract = {Asample of 109 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with recession velocity le 30,000km s-1 is compiled from published SN Ia light curves to explore the expansion rate of the local universe. Based on the color parameter DeltaC12 and the decline rate Deltam15, we found that the average absorption-to-reddening ratios for SN Ia host galaxies are R{\_}UBVI = 4.37 pm 0.25, 3.33 pm 0.11, 2.30 pm 0.11, and 1.18 pm 0.11, which are systematically lower than the standard values in the Galaxy. We investigated the correlations of the intrinsic luminosity with light-curve decline rate, color index, and SN environmental parameters. In particular, we found that SNe Ia in E/S0 galaxies close to the central region are brighter than those in the outer region, which may suggest a possible metallicity effect on SN luminosity. The dependence of SN luminosity on galactic environment disappears after corrections for the extinction and DeltaC12. The Hubble diagrams constructed using 73 Hubble flow SNe Ia yield a 1 sigma scatter of le 0.12mag in BVI bands and le 0.16 mag in U band. The luminosity difference between normal SNe Ia and peculiar objects (including SN 1991bg–like and SN 1991T–like events) has now been reduced to within 0.15 mag via DeltaC12 correction.We use the same precepts to correct the nearby SNe Ia with Cepheid distances and found that the fully corrected absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia are M{\_}B = -19.33 pm 0.06 and M{\_}V = -19.27 pm 0.05. We deduced a value for the Hubble constant of H{\_}0 = 72 pm 6 (total) km s-1 Mpc-1.},

abstract = {We report Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of the Ly$\alpha$ emission and interstellar absorption lines in a sample of 10 star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 0.2. Selected on the basis of high equivalent width optical emission lines, the sample, dubbed “Green Peas,” make some of the best analogs for young galaxies in an early universe. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in all ten galaxies, and 9/10 show double-peaked line profiles suggestive of low H i column density. We measure Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratios of 0.5–5.6, implying that 5{\%}–60{\%} of Ly$\alpha$ photons escape the galaxies. These data confirm previous findings that low-ionization metal absorption (LIS) lines are weaker when Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and equivalent width are higher. However, contrary to previously favored interpretations of this trend, increased Ly$\alpha$ output cannot be the result of a varying H i covering: the Lyman absorption lines (Ly$\beta$ and higher) show a covering fraction near unity for gas with NH i ≳ 1016 cm‑2. Moreover, we detect no correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape and the outflow velocity of the LIS lines, suggesting that kinematic effects do not explain the range of Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratios in these galaxies. In contrast, we detect a strong anticorrelation between the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the velocity separation of the Ly$\alpha$ emission peaks, driven primarily by the velocity of the blue peak. As this velocity separation is sensitive to H i column density, we conclude that Ly$\alpha$ escape in these Green Peas is likely regulated by the H i column density rather than outflow velocity or H i covering fraction.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 12928 and 11727.},

abstract = {Using the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging data and multi-wavelength photometric catalog, we investigated the dust temperature of passively evolving and star-forming galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0 in the CANDELS fields. We estimated the stellar radiation field by low-mass stars from the stellar mass and surface brightness profile of these galaxies and then calculated their steady-state dust temperature. At first, we tested our method using nearby early-type galaxies with the deep FIR data by the Herschel Virgo cluster survey and confirmed that the estimated dust temperatures are consistent with the observed temperatures within the uncertainty. We then applied the method to galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0, and found that most of passively evolving galaxies with Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} Msun have a relatively high dust temperature of Tdust {\textgreater} 20 K, for which the formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen on the surface of dust grains in the diffuse ISM is expected to be very low from the laboratory experiments. The fraction of passively evolving galaxies strongly depends on the expected dust temperature at all redshifts and increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around Tdust {\~{}} 20 K. These results suggest that the dust heating by low-mass stars in massive galaxies plays an important role for the continuation of their passive evolution, because the lack of the shielding effect of the molecular hydrogen on the UV radiation can prevent the gas cooling and formation of new stars.},

We study Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs) at z{\textgreater}2 selected by Js - Ks {\textgreater} 2.3 and compare them to a sample of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z=2-3. The observed UV-to-8 micron spectral energy distributions are fit with stellar population models to constrain star formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70{\%} of the DRGs are best described by dust-reddened star forming models and 30{\%} are very well fit with old and ``dead'' models. Using only the I - Ks and Ks - 4.5 micron colors we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most massive at z{\~{}}2.5 (mean stellar mass {\textless}M*{\textgreater} = 0.8 x 10{\^{}}11 Msun) and likely formed most of their stellar mass at z{\textgreater}5. To a limit of 0.5 x 10{\^{}}11 Msun their number density is {\~{}}10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes. The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L{\_}K), implying that even a Spitzer 8 micron-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The average M/L{\_}K of the DRGs is about three times higher than that of the LBGs, and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M/L{\_}K ratios and ages of the two samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar as found in the low-redshift universe.},

abstract = {We use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 from the GMASS survey to study different star formation rate (SFR) estimators. Infrared (IR) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correct ultraviolet (UV) and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities for dust extinction and dust-corrected estimates of SFR. In the selection procedure we fully exploit the available spectroscopic information. On the basis of three continuum indices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in which old stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to IR luminosity (LIR) and continuum reddening. Using Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS data we derive LIR for two-thirds of our sample. The LIR/LUV ratio is used as a probe of effective attenuation (AIRX) to search for correlations with continuum and spectroscopic features. The relation between AIRX and UV continuum slope ({\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with the literature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion with respect to UV-selected samples. We find a correlation between the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line and {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}, which is the main result of this work. We therefore propose the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line EW as a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through AIRX, though the assumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actual attenuation towards the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line. We tested the issue of differential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: our results are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuation towards nebular lines. A set of relations is provided that allows the recovery of the total unattenuated SFR from UV and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities. (Abridged)},

We facilitate direct morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to Sersic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the sSFR-Sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star forming disks declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, at about 10{\%} and 15-20{\%} respectively. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star forming disk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), and approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks, than seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. We study evolutionary tracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphological transformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physical drivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and disk instabilities). We find that complex histories with multiple transformative events are the norm.},

abstract = {With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) surveys, K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of {\~{}}600 observed spectra of {\~{}}100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

abstract = {In the redshift interval {\$}z=2-3{\$}, the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be different from those in the local Universe because of lower gaseous metallicities and higher gas fractions, and observations suggest higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and harder UV radiation fields may be common. In this Letter, based on the spectra of H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-selected star-forming galaxies at {\$}z{\$}=2.5 taken with the Multi-Object Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck-1 telescope, we measure electron densities ({\$}n{\_}e{\$}) using the oxygen line ratio ([OII]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the electron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we find for the first time that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of SFR ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}) are correlated with the electron density at {\$}z{\$}=2.5. The {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}-n{\_}e{\$} relation is likely to be linked to the global star formation law (Kennicutt-Schmidt law) where star formation activity is regulated by gas density. Moreover, we discuss the mode and geometry of star formation in those galaxies, based on the correlation between sSFR and {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}. Highly star-forming galaxies (with high sSFR) tend to be characterized by compact dense regions with high values of both {\$}n{\_}e{\$} and {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) for 14 z{\~{}}2 galaxies with existing CO(3-2) measurements, including 11 galaxies which contain active galactic nuclei (AGN) and three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). We combine this sample with an additional 15 z{\~{}}2 galaxies from the literature that have both CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) measurements in order to evaluate differences in CO excitation between SMGs and AGN host galaxies, measure the effects of CO excitation on the derived molecular gas properties of these populations, and to look for correlations between the molecular gas excitation and other physical parameters. With our expanded sample of CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio measurements, we do not find a statistically significant difference in the mean line ratio between SMGs and AGN host galaxies as found in the literature, instead finding r{\_}3,1=1.03+/-0.50 for AGN host galaxies and r{\_}3,1=0.78+/-0.27 for SMGs (or r{\_}3,1=0.90+/-0.40 for both populations combined). We also do not measure a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the line ratios for these populations at the p=0.05 level, although this result is less robust. We find no excitation dependence on the index or offset of the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for the two CO lines, and obtain indices consistent with N=1 for the various sub-populations. However, including low-z "normal" galaxies increases our best-fit Schmidt-Kennicutt index to N{\~{}}1.2. While we do not reproduce correlations between the CO line width and luminosity, we do reproduce correlations between CO excitation and star formation efficiency.},

abstract = {The Star Formation Rate (SFR) is one of the main parameters used to analyze the evolution of galaxies through time. The need for recovering the light reprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolution far-infrared data. Recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative, although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging or long-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability. Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is clearly the way to overcome such limitation. We obtain integrated H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)-based SFR measurements for 272 galaxies from the CALIFA survey at 0.005 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. We provide updated calibrations, both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphological type), referred to H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}. The extinction-corrected H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity agrees with the updated hybrid SFR estimators based on either UV or H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} plus IR luminosity over the full range of SFRs (0.03-20 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}). The coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born stars that is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a{\$}{\_}{\{}IR{\}}{\$}, shows a large dispersion. However, it does not became increasingly small at high attenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission would be missed. Lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 AGN host galaxies show smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and AGN to dust heating. In the Local Universe the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity derived from IFS observations can be used to measure SFR, at least in statistically-significant, optically-selected galaxy samples. The analysis of the SFR calibrations by galaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study the impact of different selection criteria in the SFR values derived.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim of this paper is twofold: i. investigate the properties of extragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the Galaxy; ii. address in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curves reported for reddened Type Ia Supernovae (SN) in connection to the environments in which they explode. Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened Type Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects are characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios (R{\_}V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by very blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is well aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN1986G is compatible with the most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy, SN2006X, 2008fp and 2014J show unprecedented behaviors. The observed deviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to the relatively large amounts of reddening characterising the objects in the sample. Conclusion: The dust responsible for the polarization of these four SN is most likely of interstellar nature. The polarization properties can be interpreted in terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous behavior is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic environment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system from which they originate. The question as to why lines-of-sight to Type Ia SN are so different from what is seen for stars in the Galaxy remains unanswered. Recent studies suggest that there is a link between the dust properties and the chemical/physical evolutionary stage of the host galaxy.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

abstract = {The FourStar galaxy evolution survey (ZFOURGE) is a 45 night legacy program with the FourStar near-infrared camera on Magellan and one of the most sensitive surveys to date. ZFOURGE covers a total of {\$}400\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}arcmin{\}}{\^{}}2{\$} in cosmic fields CDFS, COSMOS and UDS, overlapping CANDELS. We present photometric catalogs comprising {\$}{\textgreater}70,000{\$} galaxies, selected from ultradeep {\$}K{\_}s{\$}-band detection images ({\$}25.5-26.5{\$} AB mag, {\$}5\backslashsigma{\$}, total), and {\$}{\textgreater}80\backslash{\%}{\$} complete to {\$}K{\_}s{\textless}25.3-25.9{\$} AB. We use 5 near-IR medium-bandwidth filters ({\$}J{\_}1,J{\_}2,J{\_}3,H{\_}s,H{\_}l{\$}) as well as broad-band {\$}K{\_}s{\$} at {\$}1.05\backslash - 2.16\backslash \backslashmu m{\$} to {\$}25-26{\$} AB at a seeing of {\$}\backslashsim0.5{\$}". Each field has ancillary imaging in {\$}26-40{\$} filters at {\$}0.3-8\backslash \backslashmu m{\$}. We derive photometric redshifts and stellar population properties. Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts indicates a photometric redshift uncertainty {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z={\{}0.010,0.009{\}}{\$}, and 0.011 in CDFS, COSMOS, and UDS. As spectroscopic samples are often biased towards bright and blue sources, we also inspect the photometric redshift differences between close pairs of galaxies, finding {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}z,pairs{\}}= 0.01-0.02{\$} at {\$}1{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. We quantify how {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}z,pairs{\}}{\$} depends on redshift, magnitude, SED type, and the inclusion of FourStar medium bands. {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}z,pairs{\}}{\$} is smallest for bright, blue star-forming samples, while red star-forming galaxies have the worst {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}z,pairs{\}}{\$}. Including FourStar medium bands reduces {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}z,pairs{\}}{\$} by 50$\backslash${\%} at {\$}1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. We calculate SFRs based on ultraviolet and ultradeep far-IR {\$}Spitzer{\$}/MIPS and Herschel/PACS data.

@article{Stark2013,
abstract = {The physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies have been influential in shaping our understanding of early galaxy formation and the role galaxies may play in cosmic reionization. Of particular importance is the stellar mass density at early times, which represents the integral of earlier star formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far reported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) evolve far less rapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations underpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible contamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission lines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broadband fluxes, we investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the redshift range 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 chosen because the H$\alpha$ line lies within the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 $\mu$m flux is systematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum alone, which we derive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is seen in a control sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with 3.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.6 in which there is no nebular contamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 $\mu$m flux excesses, we derive an H$\alpha$ equivalent width distribution and consider the implications for both the derived stellar masses and the sSFR evolution. The mean rest-frame H$\alpha$ equivalent width we infer at 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 (270 {\AA}) indicates that nebular emission contributes at least 30{\%} of the 3.6 $\mu$m flux and, by implication, nebular emission is likely to have a much greater impact for galaxies with z {\~{}}= 6-7 where both warm IRAC filters are contaminated. Via our empirically derived equivalent width distribution, we correct the available stellar mass densities and show that the sSFR evolves more rapidly at z {\textgreater} 4 than previously thought, supporting up to a 5× increase between z {\~{}}= 2 and 7. Such a trend is much closer to theoretical expectations. Given our findings, we discuss the prospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengths prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

@article{Riess1996,
abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes (MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a " training set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of 20 SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5{\%} for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Sandage et al. Cepheid distance scale of H0 = 64 ± 3 (statistical) km s–1 Mpc–1 (±6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 ± 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 {\textless} $\mu$ {\textless} 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.},

abstract = {We propose a method to substantially increase the flexibility and power of template fitting-based photometric redshifts by transforming a large numbers of galaxy spectral templates into a corrresponding collection of "fuzzy archetypes" using a suitable set of perturbative priors designed to account for empirical variation in dust attenuation and emission line strengths. To bypass widely seperated degeneracies in parameter space (e.g., the redshift-reddening degeneracy), we train Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) on a large "model catalogs" generated from appropriate Monte Carlo sampling of our fuzzy archetypes to cluster the predicted observables in a topologically smooth fashion. Subsequent sampling over the SOM then allows full reconstruction of the relevant probability distribution functions (PDFs) using the associated set of inverse mappings from the SOM to the underlying model parameters. This combined approach enables the multi-modal exploration of known variation among galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using large numbers of archetypes with minimal modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the power of this approach to recover full redshift PDFs using discrete Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods combined with SOMs constructed from model catalogs based on LSST {\$}ugrizY{\$} and Euclid {\$}YJH{\$} mock photometry.},

abstract = {We investigate the optical and Wide-field Survey Explorer (WISE) colors of "E+A" identified poststarburst galaxies, including a deep analysis on 190 poststarbursts detected in the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog. The poststarburst galaxies appear in both the optical green valley and the WISE Infrared Transition Zone (IRTZ). Furthermore, we find that poststarbursts occupy a distinct region [3.4]-[4.6] vs. [4.6]-[12] WISE colors, enabling the identification of this class of transitioning galaxies through the use of broad band photometric criteria alone. We have investigated possible causes for the WISE colors of poststarbursts by constructing a composite spectral energy distribution (SED), finding that mid-infrared (4--12$\backslash$micron) properties of poststarbursts are consistent with either 11.3um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, or Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) and post-AGB stars. The composite SED of extended poststarburst galaxies with 22um emission detected with signal to noise {\textgreater}3 requires a hot dust component to produce their observed 22um emission, consistent with the presence of an AGN. The composite SED of WISE 22um non-detections (S/N{\textless}3) was created by stacking 22um images and is also consistent with an AGN contribution. Given that the E+A selection selects against AGNs, the non-negligible number of AGNs found in this sample should cause us to reconsider the relative importance of the presence of an AGN in transitioning galaxies.},

abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5{\$}. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . We combine this with HST imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses {\~{}}10{\^{}}9.5 Msol at z {\~{}} 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin{\^{}}2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z{\textless}=1 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF), leading to an upturn at masses {\textless}10{\^{}}10 Msol that is not well-described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z {\~{}} 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/Msol) {\~{}} 10.65 and {\~{}}-1.5 respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. This is not the case for quiescent galaxies: the depth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly more evolution at Log(M/Msol) {\textless} 10.5 than at higher masses. We find that the total mass density (down to 10{\^{}}9 Msol) in star-forming galaxies has increased by a factor of {\~{}}2.2 since z {\~{}} 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased by a factor of {\~{}}12 .},

We find that the dust properties of the Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs) are consistent with the relation derived previously by Meurer et al. (M99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation rate measurements at a very wide range of redshifts. We directly compare our results with high redshift samples (LBGs, BzK, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having IR data either from Spitzer or Herschel. The attenuation in typical LBGs at z=2-3 and LBAs is very similar. Because LBAs are much better analogs to LBGs compared to previous local star-forming samples, including M99, the practice of dust-correcting the SFRs of high redshift galaxies based on the local calibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. We illustrate the importance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relation between UV measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated, dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.},

Here we present the first release of photometric data that contains the optical light curves of 35 Type Ia supernovae, and near-infrared light curves for a subset of 25 events. The data comprise 5559 optical (ugriBV) and 1043 near-infrared (YJHKs) data points in the natural system of the Swope telescope. Twenty-eight supernovae have pre-maximum data, and for 15 of these, the observations begin at least 5 days before B maximum. This is one of the most accurate datasets of low-redshift Type Ia supernovae published to date. When completed, the CSP dataset will constitute a fundamental reference for precise determinations of cosmological parameters, and serve as a rich resource for comparison with models of Type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {The atmospheric composition of transiting exoplanets can be characterized during transit by spectroscopy. For an Earth twin, models predict that oxygen and ozone biogenic gases should be detectable, as well as water vapour, a molecule linked to habitability as we know it on Earth. The aim is to measure the Earth radius versus wavelength at the highest spectral resolution available to fully characterize the signature of the Earth seen as a transiting exoplanet. We present observations of Dec. 21, 2010 Moon eclipse. The Earth observed from the Moon during a lunar eclipse transits in front of the Sun and opens access to the Earth atmosphere transmission spectrum. We used two different ESO spectrographs to take penumbra and umbra high-resolution spectra from 3100 to 10400$\backslash$AA. A change in moisture above the telescope compromised the UVES data. We explain how we correct this effect. The data are analyzed by three different methods, the first method being the method described in Vidal-Madjar et al. 2010 based on the analysis of pairs of penumbra spectra. The second makes use of a single penumbra spectrum, and the third of all penumbra and umbra spectra. Profiles are obtained with the three methods for both instruments. The first method gives the best result, in agreement with a model. The second method seems more sensitive to the Doppler shift of solar spectral lines with respect to the telluric lines. The third method makes use of umbra spectra that bias the result by increasing the overall negative slope of the profile. It can be corrected a posteriori from results with the first method. The three methods clearly show the spectral signature of the Rayleigh scattering in the Earth atmosphere and the bands of H2O, O2 and O3. Sodium is detected. Finally we show that the E-ELT will be able to detect the O2 A-band, and O3 and water vapour to a lesser extent, for an Earth twin at 10pc.},

The H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux is inferred based on the offset between the IRAC 3.6 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m flux and that predicted from the best-fit SED. We demonstrate that the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation rate (SFR) and therefore can serve as an independent SFR indicator. However, we also find a systematic offset in the SFR{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR{\_}UV ratios for z {\~{}} 4-5 galaxies relative to local relations (assuming the same dust corrections for nebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest tension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing the dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low metallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the L{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR ratio). Using H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} as a SFR indicator, we find a higher normalization of the star formation main sequence compared to recent SED-based determinations and also derive the SFR functions at z {\~{}} 4-8. In addition, we assess for the first time the burstiness of star formation in z {\~{}} 4 galaxies on {\textless}100 Myr time scales by comparing UV and H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}-based sSFRs; their one-to-one relationship argues against significantly bursty star-formation histories. Further progress will be made on these results, by incorporating new results from ALMA to constrain the dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift UV-selected samples.},

Combined with a prediscovery detection by the Italian Supernova Search Project, we are able to constrain the first-light time of SN 2013dy to be only 0.10 +/- 0.05 d (2.4 +/- 1.2 hr) before the first detection. This makes SN 2013dy the earliest known detection of an SN Ia. We infer an upper limit on the radius of the progenitor star of R{\_}0 {\textless} 0.25 R{\_}sun, consistent with that of a white dwarf. The light curve exhibits a broken power law with exponents of 0.88 and then 1.80. A spectrum taken 1.63 d after first light reveals a C II absorption line comparable in strength to Si II. This is the strongest C II feature ever detected in a normal SN Ia, suggesting that the progenitor star had significant unburned material. The C II line in SN 2013dy weakens rapidly and is undetected in a spectrum 7 days later, indicating that C II is detectable for only a very short time in some SNe Ia. SN 2013dy reached a B-band maximum of M{\_}B = -18.72 +/- 0.03 mag {\~{}}17.7 d after first light.},

abstract = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at {\$}0.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.1{\$}. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashsim9.5{\$}) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 4{\$} Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ({\$}\backslashlesssim 2{\$} Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashsim11{\$}) grow on average fast ({\$}\backslashlesssim 2{\$} Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 3{\$} Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.},

abstract = {We present results on the dust attenuation curve of z{\~{}}2 galaxies using early observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Our sample consists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts in the range z= 1.36-2.59 and high S/N measurements of, or upper limits on, the H-alpha and H-beta emission lines obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct composite SEDs of galaxies in bins of specific SFR and Balmer optical depth in order to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the UV through near-IR for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our results imply an attenuation curve that is very similar to the SMC extinction curve at wavelengths redward of 2500 Angstroms. At shorter wavelengths, the shape of the curve is identical to that of the Calzetti relation, but with a lower normalization (R{\_}V). Hence, the new attenuation curve results in SFRs that are {\~{}}20{\%} lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti attenuation curve. Moreover, we find that the difference in the reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs larger than 20 Msun/yr assuming a Chabrier IMF, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of {\~{}}20 Msun/yr. [Abridged]},

abstract = {Star-forming galaxies at redshifts z{\textgreater}6 are likely responsible for the reionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of these galaxies. We present three candidates for z{\~{}}7 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) from a 155 arcmin{\^{}}2 area in the CANDELS/COSMOS field imaged by the deep FourStar Galaxy Evolution (zFourGE) survey. The FourStar medium-band filters provide the equivalent of R{\~{}}10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z{\~{}}7 LBGs and brown dwarf stars. The distinction between stars and galaxies based on an object's angular size can become unreliable even when using HST imaging; there exists at least one very compact z{\~{}}7 candidate (FWHM{\~{}}0.5-1 kpc) that is indistinguishable from a point source. The medium-band filters provide narrower redshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. The UV luminosity function derived using the three z{\~{}}7 candidates is consistent with previous studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (MUV -21.6 mag) from z{\~{}}7 to z{\~{}}5. Fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, we predict Lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest LBGs, and find that the presence of a Lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux thereby changing the constraints on stellar masses and UV spectral slopes. This illustrates the limitations of deriving LBG properties using only broad-band photometry. The derived specific star-formation rates for the bright LBGs are {\~{}}13 per Gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity LBGs, implying that the star-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.},

abstract = {We present new calibrations of far-ultraviolet (FUV) attenuation as derived from the total infrared to FUV luminosity ratio (IRX) and the FUV-NUV color. We find that the IRX-corrected FUV luminosities are tightly and linearly correlated with the attenuation-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities (as measured from the Balmer decrement), with a rms scatter of {\$}\backslashpm 0.09{\$} dex. The ratios of these attenuation-corrected FUV to H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities are consistent with evolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formation rate over 100 Myr, solar metallicity and either a Salpeter or a Kroupa IMF with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100$\backslash$msun. The IRX-corrected FUV to Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosity ratios do not show any trend with other galactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. In contrast, FUV attenuation derived from the FUV-NUV color (UV spectral slope) show much larger random and systematic uncertainties. When compared to either Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities or IRX-corrected FUV luminosities the color-corrected FUV luminosities show {\$}\backslashsim 2.5{\$} times larger rms scatter, and systematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and other parameters. Linear combinations of 25um and 1.4GHz radio continuum luminosities with the observed FUV luminosities are also well correlated with the Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities. These results provide useful prescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates of galaxies based on linear combinations of UV and IR or radio luminosities, which are presented in convenient tabular form. Comparisons of our calibrations with attenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws are also made.},

We construct a new hierarchical Bayesian regression model and Gibbs sampler to estimate the statistical dependence of the intrinsic colors of a SN Ia on its ejecta velocity, while accounting for the random effects of intrinsic scatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust. The method is applied to the apparent color data from BVRI light curves and Si II velocity data for 79 nearby SN Ia. Comparison of the apparent color distributions of high velocity (HV) and normal velocity (NV) supernovae reveals significant discrepancies in B-V and B-R, but not other colors. Hence, they are likely due to intrinsic color differences originating in the B-band, rather than dust reddening. The mean intrinsic B-V and B-R color differences between HV and NV groups are 0.06 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. Under a linear model for intrinsic B-V and B-R colors versus velocity, we find significant slopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s), respectively. Since the ejecta velocity distribution is skewed towards high velocities, these effects imply non-Gaussian intrinsic color population distributions with skewness up to +0.3. Accounting for the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections in A{\_}V extinction estimates as large as -0.12 mag for HV SN Ia and +0.06 mag for NV events. Deviance information criteria strongly favor simple functions for intrinsic colors versus velocity over no trend, while higher-order polynomials are disfavored. Velocity measurements from SN Ia spectra have potential to diminish systematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddening affecting supernova distances.},

abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2007if, an overluminous (M{\_}V = -20.4), red (B-V = 0.16 at B-band maximum), slow-rising (t{\_}rise = 24 days) type Ia supernova in a very faint (M{\_}g = -14.10) host galaxy. A spectrum at 5 days past B-band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si II and C II at {\~{}}9000 km/s. A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na I D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in I-band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN2007 if also displays a plateau in the Si II velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the $\backslash$ion{\{}Si{\}}{\{}2{\}} velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN2007 if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 +/- 0.2 solar masses, with 1.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of nickel-56 and with 0.3-0.5 solar masses in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNeIa.},

abstract = {We combine molecular gas masses inferred from CO emission in 500 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between z = 0 and 3, from the IRAM-COLDGASS, PHIBSS1/2, and other surveys, with gas masses derived from Herschel far-IR dust measurements in 512 galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. We constrain the scaling relations of molecular gas depletion timescale (t depl) and gas to stellar mass ratio (M mol gas/M* ) of SFGs near the star formation "main-sequence" with redshift, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass (M* ). The CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that the CO → H2 mass conversion factor varies little within ±0.6 dex of the main sequence (sSFR(ms, z, M *)), and less than 0.3 dex throughout this redshift range. This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that t depl scales as (1 + z)-0.3 × (sSFR/sSFR(ms, z, M *))-0.5, with little dependence on M *. The resulting steep redshift dependence of M mol gas/M * ≈ (1 + z)3 mirrors that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas fractions at high M* are driven by the flattening of the SFR-M * relation. Throughout the probed redshift range a combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale causes a larger sSFR at constant M *. As a result, galaxy integrated samples of the M mol gas-SFR rate relation exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With these new relations it is now possible to determine M mol gas with an accuracy of ±0.1 dex in relative terms, and ±0.2 dex including systematic uncertainties. Based on observations with the Plateau de Bure millimetre interferometer, operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy in the Millimetre Range (IRAM), which is funded by a partnership of INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

abstract = {We provide the first observational constraints on the sizes of the faintest galaxies lensed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. Ionizing radiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF initiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot really assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their sizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end slope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size constraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the detectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very dependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain detectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low shear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably, however, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies and the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu{\textgreater}10 z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies seen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint ({\~{}}-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We constrain their half-light radii to be {\textless}{\~{}}30 mas ({\textless}160-240 pc). As a 2nd size probe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major shear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic half-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely faint z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset (half-light radii conservatively {\textless}30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results suggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities for faint z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived in many recent studies (by factors of {\~{}}2-3 and by dalpha{\textgreater}{\~{}}0.1-0.3).},

Fitting the 60,100 and 850 micron fluxes with a single temperature dust model gives the sample mean temperature T=36 K and beta = 1.3. We do not rule out the possibility of dust which is colder than this, if a 20 K component was present then our dust masses would increase by factor 1.5-3. We present the first measurements of the luminosity and dust mass functions, which were well fitted by Schechter functions (unlike those 60 microns). We have correlated many global galaxy properties with the submillimetre and find that there is a tendancy for less optically luminous galaxies to contain warmer dust and have greater star formation efficiencies (cf. Young 1999). The average gas-to-dust ratio for the sample is 581 +/- 43 (using both atomic and molecular hydrogen), significantly higher than the Galactic value of 160. We believe this discrepancy is due to a cold dust component at T {\textless} 20 K. There is a suprisingly tight correlation between dust mass and the mass of molecular hydrogen as estimated from CO measurements, with an intrinsic scatter of {\~{}}50{\%}.},

abstract = {We use the Mitchell Spectrograph (formerly VIRUS-P) on the McDonald Observatory 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope to search for the chemical signatures of massive elliptical galaxy assembly. The Mitchell Spectrograph is an integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sq arcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of {\~{}}20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eight galaxies in our sample. Focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions sigma* {\textgreater} 150 km/s, we study the radial dependence in the equivalent widths (EWs) of key metal absorption lines. By twice the effective radius, the Mgb EWs have dropped by {\~{}}50{\%}, and only a weak correlation between sigma* and Mgb EW remains. The Mgb EWs at large radii are comparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that are approximately an order of magnitude less massive. We find that the well-known metallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continue smoothly to 2.5R{\_}e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. Much like the halo of the Milky Way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have low metallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old stars formed in small stellar systems. Our observations support a picture in which the outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion of much smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.},

abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present day and initial mass functions in various components of the Galaxy, disk, spheroid, young and globular clusters. As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for {\$}m\backslashga 1 \backslashmsol{\$} and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashpc3{\$}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashmsol{\$}. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

abstract = {We compare galaxy scaling relations as a function of environment at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} with our ZFIRE survey where we have measured H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} fluxes for 90 star-forming galaxies selected from a mass-limited [{\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textgreater}9{\$}] sample based on ZFOURGE. The cluster galaxies (37) are part of a confirmed system at z=2.095 and the field galaxies (53) are at {\$}1.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.4{\$}; all are in the COSMOS legacy field. There is no statistical difference between H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting cluster and field populations when comparing their star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}), galaxy size ({\$}r{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}), SFR surface density [{\$}\backslashSigma{\$}(H{\$}\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}star{\}}{\$})], and stellar age distributions. The only difference is that at fixed stellar mass, the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting cluster galaxies are {\$}\backslashlog(r{\_}{\{}eff{\}})\backslashsim0.1{\$} larger than in the field. Approximately 19{\%} of the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitters in the cluster and 26{\%} in the field are IR-luminous ({\$}L{\_}{\{}IR{\}}{\textgreater}2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} L{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}). Because the LIRGs in our combined sample are {\$}\backslashsim5{\$} times more massive than the low-IR galaxies, their radii are {\$}\backslashsim70{\$}{\%} larger. To track stellar growth, we separate galaxies into those that lie above, on, and below the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} star-forming main sequence (SFMS) using {\$}\backslashDelta{\$}SFR{\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}})=\backslashpm0.2{\$} dex. Galaxies above the SFMS (starbursts) tend to have higher H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} SFR surface densities and younger light-weighted stellar ages compared to galaxies below the SFMS. Our results indicate that starbursts (+SFMS) in the cluster and field at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} are growing their stellar cores. Lastly, we compare to the (SFR-{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}) relation from RHAPSODY cluster simulations and find the predicted slope is nominally consistent with the observations. However, the predicted cluster SFRs tend to be too low by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim2{\$} which seems to be a common problem for simulations across environment.},

@article{Simha2014,
abstract = {We examine the star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, compare them to parametric models that are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energy distributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practical tools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. The commonly used tau-model, with SFR {\~{}} exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the SFH of our SPH galaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads to systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A one-parameter lin-exp model, with SFR {\~{}} t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. We introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1) the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full SPH star formation histories using the FSPS code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by {\~{}} 0.2 dex, overestimate population ages by {\~{}} 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate sSFR by {\~{}} 0.05 dex. Fits with lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than 1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our recommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.},
